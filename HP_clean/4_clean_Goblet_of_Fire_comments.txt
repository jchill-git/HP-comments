'      'if harry potter were real life  harry and his friends would be moving onto high school after completing their first three years at hogwarts. with important discoveries at the end of their third year that penetrate magic at its deepest reaches  harry is about to begin his fourth year of his magical education. dark forces are gathering  as had been predicted throughout the first three books. with his servant returned to him  lord voldemort is determined to rise again  more powerful and lethal than ever before. harry senses that something may be amiss because his scar  his connection to voldemort  has bothered him over the summer. reaching out to his father figures  it is apparent to all that voldemort is gathering strength  and harry represents the best chance to conquer him; that is  if he can get through a year at hogwarts complete with teenaged love and angst and new magical tasks awaiting him as he furthers his education. with these forces both inside and outside of hogwarts building up  determined to do harry in  the fourth year at hogwarts figures to be the most dangerous one yet. '      'with summer vacation nearly over  harry returns to his friend’s ron’s house named the burrow to see the final of the quidditch world cup. rowling introduces readers to new characters at every chance she has  starting with the eldest weasley brothers bill and charlie. ron has always been conscious of the fact that he is a youngest brother  and now we see that bill and charlie have indeed been successful since leaving school. this theme of it measuring up to either harry or his brothers stays with ron for the rest of the series  and undoubtedly for the rest of his life. here the family is at its magical best from the twins inventing jokes to the fully qualified wizards using their wands to perform mundane everyday tasks. we find another form of transportation  a portkey  an everyday object that allows the user to be teleported to a new location instantly; of course  a portkey will reappear later in the book as rowling does not introduce minor characters or items unless they have a purpose later on. the scene in the movie while the kids look so innocent traveling awash in color contrasts how their lives are about to change with these dark forces conspiring to overtake the world. the color and innocence of childhood is about to end  and then harry  ron  hermoine  and their contemporaries return to another year at school. '      'professor dumbledore introduces the tri wizard tournament to be played against champions from two other wizarding academies. one must be seventeen to enter by placing their name in the goblet of fire  which is guarded by dumbledore’s age line. fred and george would love to enter as the winner receives one thousand galleons  which they would love to start a joke shop; even they are no match for dumbledore’s advanced magic. somehow  someone who wants harry dead places his name into the goblet of fire. although only fourteen  harry is now bound to participate along with the other three champions. his friends and enemies show their true colors as the tournament progresses  those aligning with him as a beacon of hope and those who support the other hogwarts champion while also being staunch pure blood wizards who are eagerly awaiting the return of voldemort. the tasks in the tournament  which include battling dragons  mer people  and various magical creatures and hexes pale in comparison to the constant fear that would blanket the wizarding world should voldemort return to power. harry  exhibiting the mettle that has allowed him to overcome voldemort on multiple occasions  represents the best hope for both the tournament and defeating voldemort again. here as the arc of the series reaches its apex  it is obvious that harry will be destined to fight voldemort again. the education he receives during this fourth year will be crucial down the road if he is to win that battle. '      'rowling interjects light moments throughout the book as well: fred and george’s determination to create jokes  ron and hermoine’s growing relationship which comes to a head at the yule ball  the foul reporter rita skeeter. readers acquire more magical knowledge as well. dumbledore siphons his thoughts into a basin called a pensieve. this object will continue to play a role throughout the series  but here we learn about the trials against voldemort’s supporters during his first downfall. we find new information about neville’s family as well as professor snape  and wonder whose side he is really on  something that isn’t resolved until the end. hagrid notes that whatever comes  will come  and rowling notes that the division within the magical community between those who value pure blood and those who value ability are more pronounced that ever. house elves and giants play a prominent role  dementors bide their time to rejoin voldemort  and sirius returns to play his role as harry’s godfather to the best of his ability. sirius’ presence throughout this book tethers harry to the magical community more than ever as he is there as a mentor and father figure  taking his place as the family harry never had  and reminding harry the need to defeat voldemort once and for all. '      'three long books remain. as i am at home with more time than i anticipated to read this series  i may finish sooner than later. it is always bittersweet as i reach this turning point in the series  as hagrid tells harry to brace for darker days ahead  just as we are doing in real life now. my kids and i are here for the long haul  both in our new reality of 2020 and on harry’s journey to eradicate darkness. we will cheer his triumphs and shed some tears as friends succumb to dark powers. even though this may mirror what is going on in real life  at least for those hours that we are immersed in harry’s world  we are experiencing a world other than our own  a world full of magic where one person gives us hope that life will be righted sooner rather than later.

second time read review
      "to be honest  it was pretty hard for me to decide how many stars i would give to the book. on one hand  i liked the book  but i didn't love it  but on the other hand i felt like i couldn't give it less that 5 stars because i wouldn't be the kind of woman i am today without this series. this series changed me and when i look back at the old version of me  i feel i don't really recognize that girl anymore. so yeah it was pretty complicated for me to rate this book. "      "i think the reason why i didn't love it because i knew what would happen  so the shock was not there anymore. but then i loved the second and third book. hmmm  it's pretty confusing when i think about it. basically  i liked this book but i didn't love it."      
cedric diggory's death
      "i cried you know when he refused to take the triwizard cup and he told harry to take it. he was just so good and noble and when harry told him to take the cup together  i was grinning while crying at the same time because i was so proud of harry's decision. but i still cannot accept his death. he didn't deserve that kind of death. i really hate voldemort and wormtail. they deserve a painful death and may them rot in hell for all the evilness they have done. honestly  i still can't believe that there are death eaters who actually support voldemort. like what the fuck? voldemort is evil and so freaking bad. "      
snape being mean to hermione
      "i do not hate snape but there were moments where he just left me gaping with disbelief on my face because he acted pretty mean and annoyed me. for example is the moment where harry and malfoy were fighting and they tried to hex or curse each other  but malfoy's spell caught hermione and hermione's front teeth became longer. like very long until they passed her collar but then when snape saw them  he said "      

snape looked coldly at hermione  then said  'i see no difference.' 

      'i was shocked when i read that part because what did hermione do to deserve that kind of response? that was just so mean. i felt sorry for hermione right away in that scene. i wanted to say to her that "it\'s okay  the teeth can be fixed and snape was just being bitter."'      
the morning before the third task
      "i really love the weasley family with no exception. percy is my least favorite though. this book is indeed a reread for me but i did not remember at all about this scene where harry was told to meet his family before the final task and i totally did not know who would come because the dursleys couldn't possibly come  so who's this family? and then when i realized that it was mrs weasley and bill  my eyes suddenly became teary. it was so clear that mrs weasley  molly  cared and loved harry. harry is so lucky to have the weasley family. they're such a nice family and come to think of it  how can malfoy mock ron's family? to me it's so absurd. the weasley family is a great and i adore this family.

" lord voldemort's gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great. we can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust  differences of habit and languages are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open. "
      
my opinion
      "omg!! this book! lot of things happened and i'm still in shocked. "          "okay let's begin with cedric diggory. "      
my most saddest scene
      'cedric was a nice guy and he was really sweet and i liked him. i was so shocked when he died because i thought he would be alive until the last book and he died so fast that i just sat on my bed and i was like " what did just happen? " i still can\'t believe he died in such a young age and it was all because of voldemort. '    "oh! and i was so proud of harry too! he's so kind that he suggested cedric to hold the cup with him  so there would be two winners not only harry or cedric and i was so confused who i wanted to get the cup first  i liked cedric but i also liked harry. so i was very happy when harry suggested that but that happiness vanished as fast as it came. the cup was a portkey and the cup transported them to voldemort and cedric died so fast that i didn't even cry. i was just so shocked."        "because what would harry say to his parents?! and i was so worried what about if they blamed harry for this ?!? but thankfully that didn't happen. cedric's parents were very sad but they didn't blame harry. they even thanked him for returning cedric's body to them. "      
my favotite scenes
      'i think there is something change between hermione and ron.'    "ron was so mad when hermione went to the ball with viktor. he said it was because viktor was from drumstrang and he said hermione was fraternizing with the enemy. but i still don't believe this at all. before hermione went to the ball with viktor  ron liked viktor so much that he even wanted to get his autograph and i think he acted like that because he was jealous. hahaha. it was so funny and sweet to see ron got jealous and there's also this scene : "      'known what?' said ron quickly. 'you haven't been mixing up love potions  have you?''don't be stupid ' hermione snapped  starting to pound up her beetles again. ' no  it's just ... how did she know viktor asked me to visit him over the summer?'hermione blushed scarlet as she said this and determinedly avoided ron's eyes. 'what?' said ron  dropping his pestle with a loud clunk.'he asked me right after he'd pulled me out of the lake ' hermione muttered. 'after he'd got rid of his shark's head. madam pomfrey gave us both blankets and then he sort of pulled me away from the judges so they wouldn't hear  and he said  if i wasn't doing anything over the summer  would i like to -''and what did you say?' said ron  who had picked up his pestle and was grinding it on the desk  a good six inches from his bowl  because he was looking at hermione. 'and he did say he'd never felt the same way about anyone else 'hermione went on  going so red now that harry could almost feel the heat coming from her  'but how could rita skeeter have heard him? she wasn't there ... or was she? maybe she has got an invisibility cloak  maybe she sneaked into the grounds to watch the second task ...' 'and what did you say?' ron repeated  pounding his pestle down so hard it dented the desk. 'well  i was too busy seeing whether you and harry were ok to -'    "but before she could finish that sentence snape came. ugh. why did he have to come when she hadn't finish it!?!? "    "but that scene was sweet and funny wasn't it?! ahh my heart!!"          
the plot twist
  ' '      'the plot twist in this book was better than the plot twist in first book  second book and third book. '    "i swear i didn't expect that at all! i thought the bad guy was ludo bagman because he acted so strange. he asked harry whether he wanted his help or not and so i thought he was the bad guy. then there was a scene where moody was the bad guy but he wasn't moody. he was the imposter of moody and the real moody was imprisoned in his own trunk and this imposter was barty crouch's son.

book review

    '4+ of 5 stars to '  harry potter and the goblet of fire  '  the 4th book in the "harry potter" young adult fantasy series  written in 2000 by '  j.k. rowling  ". although this one was close to a 5 for me  i think it's enough to give 1 book in the series a 5-rating  which means this one will stay at a 4. but i still loved and adored the characters  the setting  the story  the themes... all of it! rather than go into a detailed review  as we've seen too many of them (always fun to read tho!)  i'm just going to chat a little bit about the parts that i enjoyed the most."      "1. the selection of the 3 students to participate in the tri-wizard tournament. it's scary to think the schools condone putting the kids at such risk  but then again  i suppose they'd stop it just before anyone died or was hurt irreparably. to imagine the goblet of fire choosing one from each school  and then harry's name being cast as a fourth one... fantastic idea and approach. i felt the drama. and i loved having him put to the test mid-way thru the series... as he never seemed to be all that good of a student or a wizard!"      '2. the introduction of new characters in this one is intense. i loved all the folks at the various stages of the competition. to see feelings emerge for one another  to know they were going thru the same unrequited love and anger we all go through as teenagers. was a good experience -- i thought it was one of the more real aspects of the series.'      '3. the imagination for all the tournaments and the dance... fantastic. i wanted to be there watching it all happen. i can only imagine how it felt to write those scenes... knowing it would propel the characters forward in a very different path by the end. and to see the drama of how it all turns out.'      'i am feeling the need to re-read this series again soon...'

      harry potter and the goblet of fire  ' was my most anticipated read of the series... it’s my favorite movie (i know i know- the books are so much better) and it’s where the books really start to get intense. even though there was a part that brought tears to my eyes  its not as sad as whats yet to come... '      'i feel like this book is the book of transitioning for harry  ron and hermione. this is the last book of their childhood. if the movies follow the books as well as i hope  shit really starts to get real after this one. there is a lot of depth to this story  the characters and it gets a bit darker than the first three. i love the tri-wizard tournament aspect and the new characters we meet. once again  i listened to the audio book and the narration was fantastic. if you’ve never read the books before  or your a long time fan- i highly recommend these audio books. the narrator does a fantastic job. i love getting lost in the world of harry potter and can’t wait to read more   "harry potter and the goblet of fire is the fourth novel in the harry potter series  written by british author j. k. rowling. it follows harry potter  a wizard in his fourth year at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry and the mystery surrounding the entry of harry's name into the triwizard tournament  in which he is forced to compete. definitely one of my favorites in the series."

'][' '   here be warned: this review contains cursing.       'greetings  loved ones  and let us talk of a young witch named hermione granger.'      "hermione is  and always has been  a delight to read. not necessarily because she's a girl  but because she is the only character amongst those 14 year olds who actually has a good head on her shoulders. "      "when i was young and gullible  i hated this book. hated how it killed off cedric and how bloody the series got afterwards. i hated it enough to renounce the franchize. now that i re-read it  i still hate it  but for all different reasons. cedric  on second reading  is as dull as toast (so i guess the movie casting must have been really spot-on). harry has finally started to shed his unnatural maturity  and has turned just as obnoxious as most boys at 13. ron is a wanker. so it's beyond me why hermione hasn't stolen the spotlight here  as she is easily the most relatable character of them all."      "let's look at her character - she is from a muggle family  but through hard work she has become the best student in the school. she studies hard  follows the rules  but makes exceptions when the circumstances are right. she comes off as stuck-up at first  but looks after her friends. she keeps her promises  even though she barely has time to take care of herself. and yet ron is harry's best friend  not her."      'why?'      "harry and ron are much closer than harry and hermione. in the previous book  hermione was at odds with the boys not one  but twice  and that put a serious hinge on their friendship. even so  that doesn't nearly come close to the drama that follows harry and ron's falling out in this book. and then  when they do make up  hermione is once again pushed back as a tercery best friend  even though she sacrificed her efforts and sleep in order to help harry learn a spell that would save his skinny ass."      "hermione is defined by her intelligence. it falls squarely on her shoulders to help the guys when they're in a pickle - whenever they discover that rushing at an obstackle headfirst isn't going to cut it  they turn to her for advice  and she's also acutely aware of issues of inequality. in this book  she actually starts an organisation to help house elves! she stands up for hagrid when rita skeeter takes a sling at him  and she kept lupin's secret for months in book three simply because she believed he was a good guy! and where do her efforts to promote equality lead to? they're used for comedic relief."      "it's equally disgusting how little the boys seem to appreciate her. not only do they refuse to take her seriously  they consider she's for granted. i mean  sure  harry has lived with his relatives as an upper middle class brat (a much abused middle class brat)  but hermione's parents are dentists and yet she has a better awareness of social issues than he does! is rowling trying to suggest that young activism is only for women  because only women seem aware of these issues?"      "but that's not even the worst this book gets. on the yule ball  harry and ron take ages before they realize hermione is a girl  and thus  qualified to be a dance partner (obiously  they can't go with each other  altough it would be most logical  what with all the sparks flying among them). hermione  though  refuses to be taken for granted. she knows she deserves better than to be a go-to girl  and she does - she gets to be viktor krum's date  and she damn well got someone who appreciates her! but are her friends happy for her? no  they're shocked  and in ron's case  offended  that she dared *gasp* make plans without them! ron goes as far as to make a scene - in which he (not for the first time) makes hermione cry. this was supposed to establish some beginnings of the love between hermione and ron  but  quite frankly  it just makes ron look like a wanker. "      'after rita skeeter\'s article  hermione becomes the target for bullying which  in some cases  turns rather dangerous. grown-up witches send her hate mail packed with all sorts of deadly stuff  one of which makes the skin of her hands fall off. ron\'s commentary? she should have seen it coming  messing around with the paparazzi like that. i bet the bumrag was happy she got punished for liking krum. but that\'s not even what\'s most disturbing about this thing - it\'s that witches who have never even met hermione before are willing to take skeeter\'s word for it  even if the woman\'s as trustworthy as a snake. even mrs. weasley  whose own husband got blackened twice in "the daily prophet"  believes her! nice message for female solidarity  ms rowling  real subtle.'      "again  i ask  why can't hermione be the hero of these series? i don't think i'm alone in thinking it could be so much "  better  '.           ']['                        this book was so much darker and sadder than i remembered - the crazy thing is  goblet of fire was always my least favorite as a kid because between the qudditch world cup and the twiwizard tournament  i just associated it with being the "sports one". but this book has so much going on and it made me feel way more feels than i remembered  and it all really hit me in ways i hadnt expected. '      "i'm so glad harry has molly weasley  and hagrid  and so many other wonderful people in his life. i couldn't believe how real the argument between dumbledore and cornelius fudge felt at the end  when fudge refused to believe voldemort was back. i had forgotten so many details about winky's part in the book  and rita skeeter  and the overall delightfulness of hermione's weird relationship with victor.

"]['                        goblet is hand\'s down my son\'s favorite harry potter novel. from the quiddich world cup to the rebirth of voldemort  it is nonstop action (with quite a bit of comedy thanks to ron and others.) our favorite characters feature prominently (and none are killed off...yet) such as  her gandalf dumbledore and sirius black. i found it entertaining and really enjoyed all the inventive ideas around magic that rowling comes up with. i kept saying to myself  "why didn\'t i think of that?"'      'the character development is interesting too as harry is clearly heading into adolescence and having issues with girls. the yuletide dance scene was absolutely the best part of the book  i thought. and  for the francophones reading this review  the french translation misses entirely the sly humorous french and eastern european accents that rowling uses for the beauxbatons girls and the durmstrang boys which were hilarious! that being said  i was a little disappointed with the fleur delacourt character from beauxbatons. as the only girl among the four champions  she totally sucked at all three challenges. not a very encouraging model for french girls or girls in general. i mean  i know harry always has to win  but perhaps it would have been a wee bit better and even more suspenseful if fleur had placed a bit higher. '      "a note about the movie: it was frustrating! the movie skipped easily half of the book or more - no quidditch at all :( - and i don't know how folks could have followed the action without having read the book because to my eyes  there were a lot of nonsequitors (like the poor editing of the death eater scene following the quidditch world cup.) i definitely would recommend reading the book if you only saw the movie. far better!          "]['                        this is by far  so far  the darkest book of them all. grim is the beginning of the book  grimmer is the foreshadowing and grimmest is the ordeal through which harry alone survives.'      "harry's trick of conveying only what he sees or dreams of is well poised in the book's narrative. it's the balance of the known and unknown that is intriguing. so many things happen."      "one can barely cope with the events in the book. and we have to sort them according to what our theories are. harry potter is extraordinary in his ordinariness. magic is so innately superficial in book 4  that's it's used as a tool rather than a luxury. that's it  from me.          "]["                        finally ready to get back to this. i actually listened to the first 150ish pages last weekend when i was on the road  and i didn't kneel over. of course  snape's not been mentioned yet  so we'll see . . . *crosses fingers*"                    ' ']["                        now that's a book! the groove that j.k. rowling starts to find in hp 3 is fully realized in 4. partly it's that the kids (and therefore the readers) are getting older so she can delve into more adult  complex themes and situations  and partly it's that i think she's really finding her voice. we finally got our very own hp's  i am happy to report  and it's so funny to look at them all side by side b/c of the huge leap in size between 3 and 4. then they get a little tricky b/c while 4 and 5 look to be about the same length  the font in order of the phoenix is much smaller  hence a longer book. i just started that one and it honestly feels longer already. more of a book book and less of a fun afternoon's diversion. but i like these books as they get both darker and longer."      'but to focus on goblet of fire specifically for a moment...again  not that i think i can bring anything new to the table in discussing these books. nevertheless  i\'ll throw a few ideas out there just for your reading pleasure. one thing that struck me  as i mentioned before  was the increasing maturity and complexity of situations and themes. clearly having someone die is a huge deal and i found that whole series of events really moving this time around. i may have last time as well  but i don\'t remember. in a way  though  some of the more complex issues feel jarring next to the goofy concepts she originally created. calling non-magical people "muggles " for instance. it\'s just a stupid word and yes  it sounds funny and makes kids laugh  but sometimes it\'s hard to take all these people seriously. "mud-bloods" on the other hand is vicious and definitely drives the point home. i just wonder if she was to do it over again if some of those terms or ideas would change a bit. yes  we\'d all like to revisit what we did/wrote when we were less sure of ourselves and our voices and ideas  but of course we can\'t and neither can she. and what do i know? she claims she always knew what would happen to harry  so maybe for her "muggle" is the ideal word.'      'since  as usual  i find it impossible to discuss the books without referencing the films  let me just say that although i hated dobby in the movie (2?) and was glad to see him mostly cut from subsequent screen incarnations  i really loved him in this one. the dialogue is actually quite funny and hermione\'s whole s.p.e.w. thing just cracks me up. yes  i know a lot of people hate it and find it annoying and whatever  but i love it. of course she would have a cause like that. that\'s who she is! and poor winky. they\'re weird creatures (and oh how i love kreacher in the next one!) and i can\'t decide whether i am with hermione or everyone else on their "plight." either way  i like that they exist; they provide a bit of moral ambiguity in a world that is mostly cleanly divided between good and evil. you might wonder about people  but for the most part they end up squarely one or the other. other than snape - another great piece of moral ambiguity whose complexity grows from book to book.'      "i also continue to marvel at rowling's ability to write about the teenage mind. ron and harry's fight is spot on  as are hermione's various reactions to it. and oh these poor boys having to ask the girls to the feast. i wish i had known when i was in middle school how truly hard it was for boys to talk to girls like that. although i probably wouldn't have cared  being the good self-involved teenger that i was.

"      '-------'      (view spoiler)  [original review (4/9/11):ack! i am hopelessly behind on book reviews. i read this  like  two weeks ago and i've read four other books since then. i am a bad little book reviewer *bashes head against wall* although  it's not like a ton of people read my reviews  i guess. i just like writing them because it makes me feel smarter-er. :)so yeah  harry freaking potter. if you haven't been reading my reviews of the past three books––yes  i'm reading them for the first time. i know  shocking. whenever people see me reading them at school they're like  "haha  reading harry potter again?" and i'm like "meep ... this is the first time." and everyone's like  "whaaaaaaaat?!" *cowers* i know  i know. i'm terribly behind on the times.well  anyway. as for actually reviewing this thing.this was definitely my favorite so far. without a doubt. i liked the first three  but not as much. in the first three  i had some issues with pacing and the writing style  etc. the first was really rushed  the second was better  the third was good but only really addicting toward the end ... but this one  i was hooked pretty much the entire time. i tend to be skeptical of chunky books  but i think this one benefited from being long––and the first two definitely could have benefited from being longer  since they both involved a lot of events in rapid succession that could have used some down-time in between.so yeah  this one was epic. the plot was fast-paced but not confusing-fast as it was in the earlier books. there was more action  the characters were developed a lot more (i like them waaaay better now)  and the over-all mood was darker and more intriguing. kind of exhausting to read  being so long  but after taking a short break i'm eager to keep reading. :) i guess the only small issue i still have is that there's always some kind of "bwa haha!" speech at the end of every book. that is  there's a lot of mystery in each book and lots of little clues  and at the end someone has to bother explaining how it all worked out for  like  ten pages ... it's like one of those action movies where the villain ties down the hero and says  "i bet you'll never guess how i managed to accomplish all this. mwa ha ha!" and it's like ... yes  you're very clever. but i think in reality you'd just kill him ... ah  well. it all has to get explained somehow.anyway  i lurve it. time to read the next three. :)  (hide spoiler)]  ' ']['                        whatthefuckwhatthefuckwhatthefuck'      'i’m so ????? wow. just wow. i love one (1) boy and he is named harry potter.

']['                        ah yes  friends  this is where  in my humble opinion  this is where the legend of harry potter really takes off. there are so many things i love about this book: the quidditch world cup  the tri-wizard tournament  the yule ball  mad-eye  more sirius  etc. '      'but what i really love about this one is how it kind of serves as a bridge between the shorter  more young-adultish  magical fantasy wonder of the first three books and the final three. things get a little darker here  the story has more layers  the plot is more complex  the villains more sinister  and length of the books much longer. '      'the first three books are pretty formulaic  right? harry is home with his awful aunt and uncle  he has to find some creative way to get to hogwarts  he gets there  they eat and get sorted  it’s halloween  it’s christmas  there’s a chapter or two about a quidditch match  they have to solve some kind of problem  there’s a new teacher  harry saves the day  five million points to gryffindor  you know what i mean. '      'this one breaks the mold. in fact  hogwarts comes several chapters later. the story kicks off in a different setting  there is a huge tournament that throws a wrench into the typical plot outline  a lot of new characters are introduced  a lot of old friends return even if just for a moment  hagrid’s got some new species he can’t handle...'      'the complexity of the story really shines here  too. there are things from previous books that are suddenly important  there are characters with well-developed and integral backstories to dig into  some really crazy stuff went down a long time ago and impacts present events  and voldemort isn’t messing around this time. he devised a pretty spectacular plan to get harry  and... well... does it work?'

"oh hagrid  you sweet cinnamon roll. he has a bit of a tough time in this one (when does he not  to be honest)  but still manages to retain his dignity and come out stronger on the other side. i'm really feeling more appreciative of hagrid on this re-read. i couldn't deal with how sad i felt when he was considering resigning from his post at hogwarts following all the scandal after the daily prophet article. he got all sad and upset  and when hagrid is upset  you bet your ass i am upset!!"      "anyway  i went on a bit of a hagrid detour there... back to the book itself. i thought my big reread of 2018 would help me finally decide upon which harry potter book is my favourite. four books in and i'm already feeling conflicted between prisoner of azkaban and goblet of fire! i don't think i'll ever have a definitive answer to that question - and that ain't a bad thing."      "one of my favourite things about goblet of fire is getting to learn more about the two other wizarding schools. i am a sucker for learning and knowledge. and the whole triwizard tournament in general is just so much fun! harry's preparation and studying before teach of the tasks remind me of being in school  and given that i was one of those strange beings who enjoyed school  this is a very pleasurable reading experience."      "goblet of fire also has molly weasley being extra maternal towards harry and these scenes always pull at my heart strings. the world needs more molly weasley's - she just reminds me of my own mum (how lucky am i!). and then we also have all the drama of the yule ball! in particular  harry and ron being rude af - their poor dates!! this one also hurts my heart in terms of the big fall out between harry and ron  it just doesn't feel right when those two aren't talking. it makes me sad. trust hermione to be the one to bang their heads together and sort shit out."      "my only minor nitpick with this one is the quidditch world cup. i'm sorry  but i just could not care any less. any time quidditch comes up i'm just skimming through  skipping ahead to more important things. sports scenes like this are much more exciting to watch than read. don't care!"      "harry potter really brings out every emotion possible - from laughing your head off  to smiling broadly like an idiot at really poignant parts  to crying over that death  to getting so fucking angry at stupid rita shreever!! these books have it all - they're an emotional rollercoaster. but this is when the books start to get really dark - it's a tough ride from here  folks..."

'      "i have no problem with the idea that the wizarding establishment didn't believe (or want to believe) that voldemort was back and ergo they would naturally carry on with their lives  as would the students  so the big sporting event is not precisely my issue. it's the amount of time spent on the event i'm taking to task. as readers  we know the ultimate evil has come again  so it's hard to suspend our dread and enjoy the fun and games of the tournament  or at least it was hard for me. "      'others i\'ve spoke to don\'t seem to mind the "fun and games" aspect of this book. yes  the tri-wizard tournament is a useful tool in the fight versus evil  but it still seemed to me like rowling hadn\'t given the storyline maturation its due.
