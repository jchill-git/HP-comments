"      'the biggest compliment i can think to give an 870 page book is that i wish it had been longer. i wish this had been longer. '      "this book has always been my favorite in the series. up until it  harry’s story had been filled with light. sure  there were some tough parts earlier on  and while it's true that some darkness crept into the ending of the previous installment  for the most part  that was a pretty happy book compared to this. ron got over his jealousy  the school eventually got behind harry as a champion  and good still triumphed over evil. our hero surmounted impossible odds in the triwizard tournament and then managed to escape voldemort  yet again  and warn the wizarding world of his return. "      'and then '  bam!      'the beginning of this book hits you in the face. where you expect harry to be in the know  he’s in the dark  where you expect the daily prophet to be filled with stories about the ministry pursuing voldemort  there’s only silence  where you expect excitement about returning to hogwarts there is only frustration and angst. and you know what? you get it  you frigging get it  man. '      'because you were with harry when he faced voldemort and his death eaters alone  you stood beside him as the shades of his parents appeared from the tip of his enemy’s wand and helped save his life. and when he made it back to safety  you were just as dumbfounded as he was when the minister of magic refused to believe him  refused to believe dumbledore. '      'so how dare they? how dare they let him rot  alone  in a house full of people who hate and ridicule him  while the murderer of his parents begins to rebuild his army? how dare they feed him snippets like “we can’t tell you anything about what we’ve been doing  and we’ve been doing a lot. but don’t worry  we’ll see you soon  we just can’t tell you when”? as if he hasn’t been through enough. if anyone has the right to know what’s going on  it’s harry. doesn’t anyone know him like we do? or do they just think that they know what’s best for him better than he does? '      'and that’s part of the genius of this installment. this book grows up. where the previous four could be labeled as children’s stories  this one cannot. there are so many hard lessons and difficult themes in this  ones that a child’s mind cannot fully grasp. gone are the heroes  gone are the happy endings. this book teaches you that adults aren’t the perfect protectors you thought they were. sirius isn’t infallible. james potter isn’t infallible. albus frigging dumbledore isn’t infallible. none of them are. none of them are even fully good. and come to find out  those you thought were fully evil might not be either. this book introduces you to shades of grey  and each revelation seems to hit you harder than the last. '      'normally  i hate angst. this is mostly because i find the vast majority of what i see these days to be a sorry excuse to lengthen a story or a shoddy attempt to distract a reader from glaring issues. trying to cover up weak characterization? add some angst! want to hide those holes in your plot? add some angst! '      'the only type of angst i can stand is believable angst. rowling delivers on this. and that’s one of the many reasons that i love this book. there are a lot of other reasons  fred and george’s badassery  ginny weasley finding her voice and becoming a character in her own right  the undiluted rage that coursed through my body every time i read a scene that included delores umbridge  the incredible courage and honesty of hermione granger  the loyalty of ron weasley  neville longbottom coming into his own  the failed occlumency lessons (i will always hate snape) and the way the entire school ended up doing exactly what the sorting hat suggested at the beginning of the year and banded together as one against the ministry’s interference. '      'i even loved the ending. yes  i said it! and do you know why? because life isn’t sunshine and roses and you don’t always get to say goodbye to those you love. you don’t get the sense that sirius’s death was a righteous one. you don’t get resolution. he didn’t make some grand sacrifice to save the lives of many others. he died taunting the bad guys  smiling at them  egging them on as though he was still that ego-inflated teenager you glimpsed through the pensieve. and then you find out that it was all for nothing. that there were so many ways that it could have been avoided. how do you deal with that? the best you can  i guess.

'            3. luna lovegood-  ' because the weird people are always the best people. luna’s by far my favourite character because she is so completely herself in all her colourfulness; she’s often ignored  avoided and even ridiculed as a result but secretly she is brilliant. the world needs more luna lovegoods. i always thought she had far more chemistry with harry than ginny ever did.

'on top of all of that  you’ve got a government publishing daily articles detailing why you’re a crazy person with an overactive imagination and to pay no attention to that 100% alive noseless man behind the curtains.'

⭐️interlude: in defense of harry's angst phase
      "harry is an incredibly traumatized young adult who's just been isolated from every person who cares about him all summer. literally every single person who cares about him. you try being dropped in that situation and not being upset  especially as a fifteen-year-old. but what really stands out here is harry's character arc as he comes to be less angsty. this book took him to his bottom point and to his top and it's brilliant.

'she should have told us she'd jinxed that list -''i think it was brilliant idea ' said harry coldly  cho flushed and her eyes grew brighter.'oh yes  i forgot - of course  if it was darling hermione's idea -''don't start crying again ' said harry warningly.'i wasn't going to! she shouted.'yeah ... well ... good ' he said. 'i've got enough to cop with at the moment.''go and cope with it then!' cho said furiously  turning on her heel and stalking off. ➜ 'yeah ' said ron slowly  savouring the words  'we won. did you see the look on cho's face when ginny got the snitch right out from under her nose?''i suppose she cried  did she?' said harry bitterly 'well  yeah - more out of temper than anything  though ...' ron frowned slightly. 'but you saw her chuck her broom away when she got back to the ground  didn't you?'       "and she was totally insane  why did she have to ask about cedric to harry while they were dating. of course harry didn't want to talk abou cedric! and didn't she have feelings?! i'm sure harry didn't want to remember that horrible memory.

i don't like harry's temper

"      ' '  'been having a nice little chat with her about whether or not i'm a lying  attention-seeking prat  have you?' harry said loudly.'no ' said hermione calmly. 'i told her to keep her big fat mouth shut about you  actually. and it would be quite nice if you stopped jumping down our throats  harry  because in case you haven't noticed  ron and i are on your side.'there was a short pause.'sorry ' said harry in a low voice.'that's quite all right ' said hermione with dignity. then she shook her head. 'don't you remember what dumbledore said at the last end-of-term feast?'       'and they continued talking.'      "oh! i also didn't like harry when he shouted at professor dumbledore because he just saved his life and he's clearly older than harry  so harry had to talk calmly to him even though he was angry and the most annoying thing was that he destroyed dumbledore's possessions. he was totally rude"            "i know  i know he was sad because sirius just died and i was sad too! i cried a lot! but i didn't angry with dumbledore. i was angry with kreacher  bellatrix and voldemort. i still am  actually. how could i forgive them?! they killed sirius!

i love sirius especially young sirius
      with another shock of excitement  harry saw sirius give james the thumbs-up. sirius was lounging in his chair at ease  tilting it back on two legs. he was very good-looking; his dark hair fell into his eyes with a sort of casual elegance neither james's nor harry's could ever have achieved  and a girl sitting behind him was eyeing him hopefully  though he didn't seem to have noticed.

"2. more dementors! those have always been one of my favorite parts. and to see harry protect his cousin dudley... well that's just cool!"      '3. the whole pollyjuice potion usage at the trial is awesome.'      "4. snape's history is slowly unveiled."      '5. it sets them on the battle against the dark one to end all battles in the next couple of books!'

'she never seems to gain control of her writing  which spirals out into thousand-page doorstops filled with unimportant side characters and rambling plots. the story is moved along by arbitrary plot devices  often magic. instead of using the magic to make her world seem more strange and wondrous  she uses it to cover up plot holes. why write a consistent plot when you can just put in a spell or two to fix the problems?'      "likewise her world is poorly defined. she did not start by constructing the 'wizarding world' and then base her stories off of it  rather she changes her setting to fit whatever she needs at the moment. this constantly shifting setting means the world doesn't make much sense if you take the time to sit and think about it."      "her fractured plots are not the result of 'realism'  which some authors use to create a sense of a 'real world'  separate from archetypes. rowling is just trying to fit in all the disparate ideas and characters she has in her notepad. she becomes so attached to her characters and ideas that she is unwilling to sacrifice them for a more streamlined book."      'she has problems connecting the many dots of her story  but uses her magical \'plot devices\' to keep us from noticing that the scaffolding behind the facade is rather bare (indeed: crumbly). her rabid plot movement points away from the cracks in her storytelling: "move along  nothing to see here".'      "i find it somewhat ironic that rowling wants to 'graduate' from potter to writing adult mysteries. a mystery needs to have a tight plot  based not in the characters but in the events surrounding them. though many people tried to 'figure out' the potter books and predict them  in truth there is nothing to figure out. "      "rowling's foreshadowing is vague and unsupported  and there are just as many clues as red herrings. the only reason some of the elements seem predictable is because there was a crack team of several million people making every guess under the sun. "      'combine that with the fact that the final book introduces completely new elements to finish the plot  and we can see that rowling is not really in charge of her own pen. she is a slave to her own sentimentality. then again  so are millions around the world.'      "the only thing which makes these meandering plots move along at a reasonable pace are her characters. they connect us to the magical world  so that even if it doesn't make sense  at least we can see how it might work for the people who live in it."      "her characters are vivid  emotional  motivated  and archetypal without being banal. they may not be psychologically deep  but for a monomyth like this  that is hardly the point. most people aren't that complex  either."      'in the series  this book gets the prize for the most psychological depth and also the most consistent mood. before this  rowling was still trying to get her footing  figuring out what exactly she was writing  and trying to explain the world to her readers. '      "she finally hit her stride in 'prisoner of azkaban'  and got much of her unsure world-building out of the way in 'goblet of fire'. this is before she started feeling the pressure to wrap things up in a neat package  which again begins to take its toll on her consistency. this is the first  and really the last of her books where rowling is able to write without being overly concerned with either the beginning or ending of her series."      'instead of placing a scattered plot over her characters  rowling was instead able to let the characters travel through their own path of growth and self-exploration. the change is the most apparent in harry himself  and though his transformation is somewhat sudden  it is still honest and believable for the character.'      'by focusing chiefly on her strength--character building--and escaping the constraints of the monomyth  if only for a moment  rowling is able to avoid her weakest points as a writer and turn out her strongest book.'      my fantasy book suggestions  ' '][' '

" while the previous books were still light-hearted in the overall atmosphere in spite of certain parts of the storylines  this one consisted to approximately 95% of darkness and a lack of happiness for all the characters involved. studying at hogwarts is not enjoyable anymore  life has become dangerous for everyone everywhere  favorite teachers have been replaced by unlikeable ones  dangers and traps are looming wherever you set your feet. life is not easy for harry potter and his friends in this book  because not only do the dangers floating above their heads cloud their moods - they also slowly enter puberty with all the feelings and emotions involved with the process of growing-up. not only because of the darkness of the various themes  but also due to the character development is it impossible to call this book a children's book anymore. "      "justice is what a lot of readers - including myself - probably missed in this book. harry has won the triwizard tournament  but nobody truly acknowledges his victory. he still has to spend the summer with his merciless family  he still has to fight for his reputation and his dignity. after everything harry achieved  life reveals itself to him in its cruelest colors  the dark lord's return only being one of the many aspects influencing his decline of happiness. this book also introduces one of the most despised characters in the harry potter universe  dolores jane umbridge. who could possibly like such a woman? apart from imagining imelda staunton's inspiring portrayal from the movies which helped a lot with exploring dolores' role in the book  her unforgiving decisions and her unforgettable appearances  it can be discussed whether dolores umbridge is truly a realistic character  but she supported j.k. rowling's general direction into the dark themes of the series  and if there is one thing dolores umbridge's presence was good for  then it is this: it made harry and his friends  but also the book's readers realize that "  life is never the way you imagine it to be. life is cruel  life is hard  life is merciless.      "i love this book because it doesn't beautify things. death is presented as a necessary part of everyone's life. all the characters are created as human beings who are full of faults and mistakes. the perfect images everyone had in their minds of characters like albus dumbledore  james potter or even sirius black are shattered in the course of the book  only to allow the readers to form new opinions on those characters again. those books are set in the fantasy genre  but it all felt so realistic that it was impossible not to share the thrill and the excitement of those pages - mainly because the "  characters  ' felt so realistic. they are flawed. they are full of emotions. they come to decisions  and they regret decisions. but in their essence  they are '  human  '. which is perhaps why so many readers love this series - because it feels like you accompany people into a completely different world who might as well be your friends who are sitting at your school desk next to you.'      '[major spoiler for this novel: '  (view spoiler)  [i am not even angry with j.k. rowling for killing off sirius black. obviously  he was a character beloved by a lot of readers  and i would have loved to see sirius being redeemed officially as not having committed the crimes he was accused of. but that's the very reason for why this is my favorite novel in the series so far: just like in real life  it's not a given that the good people survive and the bad people die. you can't even always say who is good and who is evil  because there is a thin line because good and bad.

'      "let me start off by saying this book as many can tell  is humongous and requires a lot of commitment. i know that many including myself are intimidated by this book. can i also just say the writing also very small. don’t get me wrong i have nothing against long books. in fact  i prefer long books over books with only 100 pages but this book was just unnecessarily too long. i’ve realized that there is a huge amount of pointless information. i know sometimes authors can’t help it but i feel like i’m reading for so long but am not getting anywhere. now you’re probably asking why i gave it 5 stars if i think some of it was unnecessary. i am a big fan of harry potter and i know what i’m saying isn’t true but if i gave hp less than 5 stars it would make me (and i’m not saying this about anyone else) feel like i'm not a true fan. i know that’s not true but it’s what i think of "  myself  '. '      'i don’t know about anyone else but in bookstores  hp has always been in the children’s section. and i know i know hp is a supposed to be children series but honestly  i do not consider this a children’s series because well '  1.  ' i think anyone of any age can read it and '  2.  ' i cannot imagine 7 years or whatever reading an 800-page book. i don’t maybe there are children that age that do but personally i can’t imagine it.

      'what i hate so much is how harry gets all the credit! he’s not that amazing and without his friends  he would have done nothing. do you think in the first book he could have going to through that place where they had to play chess and figure out the potion without his friends? ron figured the chess game and hermione found out which potion. the only reason he could defeat voldemort was because he couldn’t be touched. also in the second book do you think he would have any idea what was down in the chamber of secrets and what was freezing all the student without hermione. i guess in the third book he did do a patronus  i’ll give him that. in the fourth book  he only won because someone was helping him but i’ll give him credit for escaping voldemort but that was because of his wand and that voldemort told him to fight him. '      'i get he is powerful but most of it was done with help. without ron and hermione  he couldn’t have done even half the things he did. i can’t even imagine what would have happened. he needs to stop thinking he’s amazing and that he is the only person to have gone through tough times because he isn’t. i actually understand draco’s pov in the situation now. '      "it pisses me off because harry is actually so dumb (i'll get into more detail about that in the 6th book) but manages to become famous and everyone thinks he so powerful. i'd like to see what he'd achieve without his friends."      'wow...i needed to get that out'

      'overall i still think this book was great. although it wasn’t the best book to try and finish a reading challenge. i’m glad i reread this book because i realized a lot and picked up things i missed before. i still loved this book and thought it was amazing. also  i understand sometimes books need to be long and cutting out sections is not easy which is why books are sometimes so long.          ']["                        now we've entered the start of the not-so-happy arc. i don't even want to think about the ending. i would much prefer to reread the first four books again than suffer (vicariously) through that ending with harry."      'the twins antics keeps the book from becoming too depressing and professor umbridge is simply divine as the big bad.

'harry potter and the order of the phoenix is very well written. i do like how the villain professor umbridge is written in this story. she appeared so sweet on the outside with her pink outfits and doilies but wicked evil on the inside with her mean ways punishments. i love prof mcgonagall’s stern attitude with prof umbridge. she’s really good with ignoring umbridge’s throat clearing. i love the humor with past headmasters’ comments. i always love prof dumbledore’s uniqueness. the magical world is neat as always  with people moving in photos and picture frames to the magical powers of reading minds. though it’s lengthy and ongoing at times  it at least offers a bit more of quidditch than the movie  so i do recommend everyone to read this book!'

(probably my all time favorite book-book that isn't a classic even though it kinda is  right?)"      'and funnily enough '  order  ' has always been my favorite  ever since i discovered as a 11 year old that my (german) copy of it had over 1000 pages (1024 pages to be exact :d) and i felt sooooooo accomplished by reading a book with over 1000 pages and "getting" it and loving it.'      'the reason why '  order  ' is so precious to me is because in this one i got the best examination of hogwarts as a school and how deep the bond between students  students and teachers and their sense of belonging to the wizarding community is. in my opinion the real villain in this wasn\'t lord voldermort but dolores umbridge. i loved that she was a threat inside of hogwarts and therefore made the students feel afraid and uncomfortable within bounds that used to be the most safest and comforting. i loved how the whole school united to take her down (except for some slytherins... but oh well jkr really needed to keep that stereotype right? smh). i laughed tears when we got to the scene in which umbridge is punishing harry constantly because he did the quibbler interview about how the dark lord is returning and fudge is telling lies. and all the other teachers want to show harry their support and so madame sprout awards gryffindor 20 points because harry passed her a fucking watering can or flitwick secretly slips him sweets after his lessons and trelawney "sees in the future" that harry would live "to ripe old age and become minister for magic". i couldn\'t man  it was sooooo fucking perfect. it made me furiously happy.'      'i also really loved the way luna was introduced and what she brought to the story. because she is kind of an outcast and a nutter but at the same time she is portrayed in such a way that you as a reader really get to see how clever and right she is about things. and her loyalty to harry gets me every time. that she actually flew with the crew to the ministry of magic is just a crazy act of bravery (because she literally only got to know harry & co. half a year ago)... this girl  man  i love her so much.'      'a lot of people think that '  order  ' is the worst in the series because "harry is so moody in this one". to people who firmly believe that all i can say is: fuck you. well that is a little harsh but i have so much compassion when it comes to harry. i feel so much protectiveness and i hate it when people give him shit. harry fucking potter was abused since he was a toddler in the most nastiest way by his uncle  aunt and cousin and he fucking remained a good person and didn\'t turn bitter or all psycho. he is the most humble character that i know and honestly sooo pure and innocent. he is used as a chess piece by dumbledore but is still willing to sacrifice himself for the greater good and he is just my little baby and if you\'re coming for him i will fight you. of course he is fucking moody in '  order  '. first and foremost he is a friggin teenager and teenagers are moody (get over it) and he feels fucking left out because dumbledore is purposefully leaving him in the dark and he is just confused as fuck. he feels estranged from his friends (and all the other students from hogwarts) because the fucking news are reporting about him and what a lying little shit he is daily. how do you deal with that? then we have the little shit umbridge who is tormenting him more than any other student and if i were harry i would be just as fucking moody as him. he has every right to be. '      "the whole sirius situation is also quite tragic. sirius isn't my favorite character because he is so manipulative and basically causing a deeper drift between harry and his friends. but on the other hand i understand sirius' behaviour to the fullest because for him harry equals james (his best friend he lost in a fucking tragic way; probs still blaming himself for his death) and on top of that he was held captive in azkaban for 13 friggin' years (thanks for nothing  dumbledore  you little shit) and his mind was just bound to be fucked because of this. so the whole sirius situation is rather complex and i feel compassion for him - especially since dumbledore (the little shit) forced him to be bound to his old childhood home - a place that only gives him anxiety and which is linked to his darkest memories (i mean can you imagine being exposed to a screaming portrait of the mother who hated you with all her heart). "      'so overall  '  order  ' had just the perfect mix of funny  tragic  beautiful  witty  depressing and real moments of any of the harry potter books and it will forever stay in my heart.'      "things i forgot to mention but that are golden in this are ron and hermione becoming fucking prefects  ron becoming a member of the quidditch team (so proud of him and the whole weasley is our king-subplot is all i needed in my life)  harry's disastrous date with cho chang in hogsmeadeeee  dumbledore's freaking army. i can't deal. soo much was in here and i could cry!!          "]['                        absolutely loved it!   "the fifth installment of the harry potter gets a bit darker with the death of a fan favorite and a sadistic new master of the dark arts at hogwarts. rowling's writing style gets a bit more rounded out and the action is fairly non-stop throughout. the order of the phoenix will have a large role to play in these last few books and we start to see a bit more humanity in some characters who have up to now been nearly demi-gods. "      'i feel like there are a few key themes throughout the hp universe in terms of critical values which i share with the author. one of the ones dealt with in order of the phoenix continues to be the mechanics of racism (in this case the (hypocritical) hate of muggles by voldemort & co. the way that rowling builds this up is a great study in terms of how both jews in europe and blacks in the us have been vilified and how even the rare jew or black can adopt the oppressive mindset due to their own self-hate and just ignore the contradictions. similarly  the treatment of house-elves which hermione has so persistently fought for (and for which ron has consistently teased her becomes a key element to the tragic climax of this particular novel. '      'on to the half-blood prince...          '][' '  “indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike.”       'the last two chapters of this book are heart-wrenching. '      'this book may not be perfect  but it was inching its way toward that finish line. i enjoy comedic  childlike humor as much as the rest of the fans  but to me when the story gets a little darker (deeper)  it gets even better. '      "we get a return of favorite characters  but as with the other books  we also get new ones. while the rest of the series introduced new characters that were fun and that we actually wanted to read about  here it just seems like two main hate-filled creatures show up: dolores umbridge (shudder) and bellatrix (who i can't stand.)"      "harry is now 15 and showing it through teenage angst and mood swings. happily this didn't bother me because - let's face it - these are dark times in the young wizard's life and him being happy-go-lucky would just be unrealistic. plus the teenager hormones were already tweaked anyway because of his friends  dumbledore  and the wizarding community basically ignoring him for a summer. then you have the voldemort strange triangle in his head  probably fueling that anger. i noticed when watching the movie that they played up the potential possession while in the book it was hinted as a possibility  left for the reader to muse about themselves and see what happens."      "hermione and ron show considerable patience with their temper-triggered friend  becoming of all things  perfects in the school. it was an ironic touch for the series but would have worked just as well without it. loony luna is a delight because the girl is simply so strange  although the convenience of her character's connected to a newspaper owning father comes into play as well. there's fred and george  who i always loved in the books but who seem lusterless in the movies - here they rocked with their unique style of misbehavior  especially when showing up a certain new villain."      "where this book shines character-wise is neville  who is so awesome as a friend suddenly and co-fighter. there's a teary situation in the hospital  and how he stands by harry (stuffed nose and all) in a fight later was heart-winning. dumbledore finally gets to show us why he has such an awesome  badass reputation in the wizarding world  and i couldn't be happier with the two scenes that showed him flexing the magic muscle."      “you know  minister  i disagree with dumbledore on many counts...but you cannot deny he's got style...”       "since snape is a favorite of mine but only shows his face occasionally  it was a further delight that harry had to learn occlumency from the professor. the scenes were intense and  although a small subplot  mesmerized me. they showed a glimpse into the life of harry's parents before he put them on a pedestal."      "can we all agree that mcgonagall is even more likable after this book? i didn't care about her the first few  but she keeps growing on me. here she's amazing. "      "sirius...ah  sirius. this book shows even further that he is dependent upon harry because he misses james so much and sees the father in the son. there was a sad scene in the fire where he withdraws from harry a bit because he's disappointed. he spends much of the book frustrated and lonely  which was realistic and deep but depressing. i love their relationship  both without families but connecting to each other due to that."      "let's wave aside the villain of voldemort for this book  shall we? he's there  he's bad  but he's not that frequent and he isn't the one who really irritated readers in this one. those badges go to the annoying umbridge we all loved to hate and the evil bellatrix. umbridge is around for the majority of book  raising shivers of annoyance. besides her arrogant attitude that made me want to slap her  there's the beyond disturbing punishment with that blood quill and poor harry. it certainly brought a twisted touch to the series that was almost missing before."      "i hate to see harry tricked at the end  but you can't keep a series real and have the character be perfect in predictions every time. the book misses that perfect finish line because there are too many lucky coincidences that come in handy and save the characters throughout fight scenes  but they were still imaginative and adventurous. it's a large book  870 pages  and if you stand back and examine it  not a lot of action actually happens. still  it's so easy to get sucked in and so hard to look away. "      "there's a heartbreaking  soul-slapping death that i don't think i'll get over. i knew it was coming  but couldn't remember the order from the movies when it would show up. sadness! it was sudden and shocking and just awful. harry's emotion afterwards was realistic and well done."      'j.k. rowling continues this series with talent  and the books really do keep getting better and better. a timeless series that should continue to bewitch future generations.

'the first three books were silly children’s books with the occasional really good part. enjoyable  but hardly remarkable. the fourth was an excruciatingly boring book that was saved by its amazing ending. '  harry potter and the order of the phoenix  '  on the other hand  is a great fantasy novel.'      'the atmosphere is finally a lot darker  the story is a lot more coherent  and several new characters  organisations  places and scenes add a lot of complexity.'      'one of the most important aspects is the expansion of severus snape’s character. one particular flashback made me understand all his actions (though not quite like him  at least not yet) and hate harry’s sorry excuse for a father more than any literary character ever.'      'the wildly interesting order of the phoenix is (obviously) introduced  several of sirius’ ancestors show up in various forms (including the absodamnlutely amazing phineas nigellus black)  dumbledore is truly shining in this instalment and the final scenes in the department of mysteries top the whole thing off greatly.'      'all in all  the second half of the series has placed itself on a much higher level than the first  and i am fully immersed in it for the first time.          ']["                        i've gotta say  i would probably give this book a 4.5 stars just because of a certain something that happens at the end  but doing that would be cruel because despite my feelings  this book was really really really good. like really. "      "i'm having such a tough time picking out a favorite of the series because they're all so good! "      "but in the end all i can really say is that umbridge is a cold-hearted b-word (can i say that word in a review? i probably shouldn't.) although some of the characters (namely harry) annoyed me throughout a majority of this book  the way that neville and ginny were more deeply developed and stepped up in the end was incredible and it made my love for them grow that much more!

'now i know lots of people know and love these characters and i don’t normally do a “character” section because people know them but i have to mention just a few because i would put it under my likes and what not but this needs its own bit!'      'firstly i’m going to come out and say it. i '  adored  ' '  neville  ' in these books  we really see him come into his own  especially in regards to the da meetings  we see him thrive in something. throughout other books he comes across as someone who isn’t seen to be really special and not very good at things  however in this. my god! i felt so proud! i think what was important is that people actually found out what happened to his parents  and because no one reacted to that he took it in his stride and actually did something about it. he stood up for harry when others were being cruel to him and he refused to take no for an answer. he was one of the last two standing! he needs more appreciation!'      'then we have '  professor mcgonagall  '  i already loved her as a character but in this  boy i loved her even more! she took no nonsense from umbridge  she was there to support others  she’s loyal and if you’re on her bad side  well. the protectiveness she has for her students and dumbledore. ahhh  my heart!'      'this time around i wasn’t as keen on '  harry  ' to begin with. like don’t get me wrong i know he’s been through a lot  but he was just so angry all of the time (like i said i know why) but it was sometimes just too much. he was fighting with anyone who tried to help  the backwards and forwards with cho didn’t really do anything for me either. however towards the end he got much better and as “the chosen one” he took it in his stride and realisation has set in so i look forward to seeing how he progresses throughout.

"i loved getting to know more about neville  dear sweet boy he is. i kind of want a spinoff series from his point of view  kind of like ender's game and ender's shadow. plus i loved that we get to know ginny a bit more in this book too  now that she's not afraid to talk in front of harry.

'the fifth book in j.k. rowling\'s harry potter series follows the darkest year yet for our young wizard  who finds himself knocked down a peg or three after the events of last year. somehow  over the summer  gossip (usually traced back to the magic world\'s newspaper  the daily prophet) has turned harry\'s tragic and heroic encounter with voldemort at the triwizard tournament into an excuse to ridicule and discount the teen. even professor dumbledore  headmaster of the school  has come under scrutiny by the ministry of magic  which refuses to officially acknowledge the terrifying truth that voldemort is back. enter a particularly loathsome new character: the toadlike and simpering ("hem  hem") dolores umbridge  senior undersecretary to the minister of magic  who takes over the vacant position of defense against dark arts teacher--and in no time manages to become the high inquisitor of hogwarts  as well. life isn\'t getting any easier for harry potter. with an overwhelming course load as the fifth years prepare for their ordinary wizarding levels examinations (o.w.ls)  devastating changes in the gryffindor quidditch team lineup  vivid dreams about long hallways and closed doors  and increasing pain in his lightning-shaped scar  harry\'s resilience is sorely tested.'      "harry potter and the order of the phoenix  more than any of the four previous novels in the series  is a coming-of-age story. harry faces the thorny transition into adulthood  when adult heroes are revealed to be fallible  and matters that seemed black-and-white suddenly come out in shades of gray. gone is the wide-eyed innocent  the whiz kid of sorcerer's stone. here we have an adolescent who's sometimes sullen  often confused (especially about girls)  and always self-questioning. confronting death again  as well as a startling prophecy  harry ends his year at hogwarts exhausted and pensive. readers  on the other hand  will be energized as they enter yet again the long waiting period for the next title in the marvelous  magical series.
