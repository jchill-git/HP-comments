"• i am utterly in love with the whole concept of hogwarts. i mean  i think it's stupid that they have to write with a quill and ink (can't they just enchant the quill to write for them?) and they seem to get an excessive amount of homework  but. it's all so vivid and detailed and it literally feels like hogwarts is a real place. i totally get why people wail about their letters going missing. "    '• speaking of detail...me likey. i always felt '  inside  ' the story.'    "• plus the audio book (narrated by jim dale) is great. i totally recommend it. i think hermione's voice had a tendency to sound like an insufferable goat  but i got used to it. harry's voice was perfection.

'    "• why didn't dumbledore pour the evil potion on the ground instead of drinking it? just wannna know..."    '• how the flying frikkin broomsticks can anyone possibly convince me snape is still on the good side? because i don\'t even care. he can go abra kadabra himself to timbuktu and die there thanks. there is no repentance after this. i don\'t even care what the "reason" is in book 7  but harry: you are an idiot to name your kid after snape. '    '• i hope snape dies.'    '• did i mention my hate for snape yet???????'    '• oh and another thing...'  i am so angry at snape arghhhqqwqq.    "• okay. good now. i'm calm. thank you. "    '• hahhahhahahte snape.'    "• yes  i truly am calm this time. i'm good."    '• '  so  ". i also am fairly annoyed about voldermort's (tom riddle) backstory. because he read like he was straight out of a psychopath text book...which i found monstrously unimaginative. attractive  calm  subtle bully  kleptomaniac  limited emotional reach  charmer  smooth...blah blah. yes. i can just read a book about psychopaths and that's voldey's description. i wish there'd been a little more ingenuity in there."    "• i really also dislike ron. i know. travesty. but he's a bully! he was bullying first year's "  the whole time  '...turfing tem off chairs  scaring them  bossing them around  taking stuff off them in the name of "prefect". like how is that good?? how is that okay??? i will not forgive ron for all this. and also the fact that he\'s a downright brute to hermione. how can i ship them when he\'s so rude and demeaning to her?? i don\'t. hermione deserves better. and i don\'t buy the "she completes him by sorting him out" because i think all humans should take responsibility for their actions. hermione shouldn\'t have to force ron into a better person and be his conscious. agh.

"]['            ** spoiler alert **            i was first introduced to harry potter in a children’s lit class in college. i had resisted this popular phenomenon until i was forced to pick it up for a grade  and book 1 was short enough that i could read it in the course of 2 hours. i have to admit i wasn’t impressed to any extent  nor did i dislike the experience  but i was critical on grounds of its being derivative  even if reading the first led to reading the second. after all  if i was bored and looking for something light  i could do worse than a fantasy about a child wizard who fights evil with his friends. but it was really the third book  with its increasing darkness  that took me in and made me a fan. '      'with a movie coming out for order of phoenix and deathly hallows on the horizon  i decided i would reread half-blood prince. i figured it would take four sittings  of course  with its 600 pages  but time does fly when reading this one  and i’ve come to the conclusion that this is my favorite so far. what i wouldn’t have been willing to admit in college that i’m perfectly comfortable saying now is that j.k. rowling is a fantastic storyteller; she writes with great clarity  wit  and humor; and she’s created a cast of loveable characters with whom most people  due to the common experience of growing up  can relate closely. '      'that said  the reason for my preference for the 6th book is that it’s the most emotionally rich in the series. here we get the backstory of voldemort (*spoiler alert*) through a series of flashbacks (coming in hp by way of magically extracted memories)  and in this way  we come to understand the villain’s similarities and differences with our hero. after all  the villain has to have reasons for committing heinous acts  and until now  we don’t know what these are.'      'voldemort is from a once-powerful wizard family reduced to poverty that lives in a dilapidated hovel on the edge of a small town  wary of outsiders  and their main point of pride is their pure blood  the lineage having cross-bred for generations so as not to pollute the line. voldemort’s mother lives with her father and brother and yearns for the love of a nonmagical man (“muggle” in this world) and when her father and brother are arrested  she uses the opportunity to bewitch her beloved and run off. she ends up pregnant  the man deserts her  and she dies while giving birth to her half-wizard  half-muggle son  thus making him an orphan (like harry).'      '(faulkner anyone?)'      'but whereas harry comes to hogwarts and befriends ron and hermione creating unity and strength through positive emotions  voldemort  when growing in the orphanage shuns other children  torturing them at times (without the awareness of adults) and stealing their possessions. what fuels him is his hatred of his beginnings  his mother’s weakness at having died like a common person despite being a witch  and the “muggle” blood inherited from his father. over the course of his time at hogwarts  voldemort  charming as only evil can be  learns to win over people as a means to an end and disguise his insidious purposes  but he never befriends anyone. he moves  through his hatred  further away from many of the emotions that drive harry  namely the desire to protect the people he loves and avenge his parents’ death.'      'with dumbledore’s help in exploring voldemort’s past  harry begins to understand that he’s come to be where he is through the choices he’s made  that his greatest strengths are an alliance with his friends  and that this might hold the key to destroying his enemy  a fact that’s made all the more poignant when dumbledore  in an all-out assault on hogwarts by voldemort’s death eaters  is killed at the end. the stakes are higher than before  the action and pace increase as the conclusion draws near  and things are looking darker than ever  which is the setup that any fan wants when the end is looming and it leaves us with the question: how will our hero prevail?

'some delights and terrors and sorrows...'        '1. fenrir greyback: bet that surprised you a little. i know that this character played a relatively minor role  but on the page he was a scene-stealer  a flesh-chewer  and a perfect foil for one of my favorite characters  remus lupin.'      'an aside: about a year before i began reading the series  my creative writing class was discussing characterization. the kids began talking about the harry potter books. one remarked that the supporting characters were as interesting as the leads  which led another student to bring up remus lupin. she was halfway through her cataloging of his merits as a character when she stopped and looked up at me  as if seeing me anew. she then said  "mr. (insert real name here). you sort of remind me of lupin." when i later found out he was a werewolf  i was a little bit shocked (and secretly pleased). but when i really got to know the character  i found the remark incredibly gratifying.'      'back to fenrir greyback (with whom i hope i have nothing in common)...'      "what made greyback so incredibly interesting to me was not only the sheer ferocity of his behavior  but the diabolical simplicity of his motives. if the harry potter books were likened to lord of the flies and voldemort's ambition were compared with jack's (the leader of the hunters)  then greyback would be roger  the sadist. this powderkeg of a character lives only to rend flesh and to guzzle the steaming lifeblood of his victims. greyback doesn't want to rule the world; he simply wants to terrorize it. i don't know what kind of a role he plays in the seventh book (if any)  but his unreasoning brutality added just the right note of menace to a book that largely---and sensitively---focused on the romantic relationships of its teenagers."        "2. fleur's surprising reaction: i admit to falling prey to a stupid prejudice here  and i feel awful about it. but i wrongly assumed fleur delacour was a pretty face without a soul. in harry potter and the goblet of fire she was the object of many male desires (ron's particularly)  and though she was skilled at wizardry  she wasn't an especially affecting character. she did seem affected  however  and when she showed up again in book six  i  like mrs. weasley  rolled my eyes and dismissed her as a fluttery  vapid future supermodel."      'how wrong i was.'      "one mark of a great writer  i think  is the ability to surprise the reader without cheating. that's j.k. rowling. when something terrible befell fleur's fiance  i was all set to mentally berate her for her superficiality. but rather than making a caricature out of fleur---as i fear i unknowingly did---rowling transformed her and made her deeply endearing with a couple elegant lines of dialogue."      "and i loved that. so here's to continual reminders to not judge people by appearances or even their seeming personalities. people can still surprise us  and we need to give them the opportunity to do so."      '*takes a deep breath*'      'and lastly...'        "3. dumbledore: if you've read this far  you've only been assailed by minor spoilers. i don't want to spoil this plot twist  but i don't know how to talk about it without spoiling it. and the fact is  i don't want to talk about it."      'rarely has a fictional character so resonated with me the way albus dumbledore has. in the first book he was wise  eccentric  and a constant source of comfort. as the series has developed  he has persisted in exhibiting those traits  but he has also grown more than most might think. he has revealed a penchant for trusting others too much. he has admitted how fallible he is  how prone to mistakes. he has been injured  accused of wrongdoing  and generally fed through a physical and emotional woodchipper.'      "and he has come through it all with an open  caring heart and an enormous capacity for love. one passage in particular  i think  summarizes this amazing character for me. in a scene that chronicles how tom riddle became lord voldemort  dumbledore attempts to gird harry's resolve and confidence in the inevitable battle with his nemesis:"      '"yes  you have " said dumbledore firmly. "you have a power that voldemort has never had. you can---"'      '"i know!" said harry impatiently. "i can love!" it was only with difficult that he stopped himself adding  "big deal!"'      '"yes  harry  you can love " said dumbledore  who looked as though he knew perfectly well what harry had just refrained from saying. "which  given everything that has happened to you  is a great and remarkable thing. you are still too young to understand how unusual you are  harry."'      '"so  when the prophecy says that i\'ll have \'power the dark lord knows not \' it just means---love?" asked harry  feeling a little let down.'      '"yes---just love " said dumbledore.'      'the above passage will strike some as too direct  too naive  or worst of all  too emotional.'      "it struck me as incredibly beautiful. there are all sorts of belief systems in the world  and no two people are exactly alike in their beliefs. but what dumbledore says here is something that  were it adopted by more people  would alter our world for the better. harry  for all his flaws  usually acts with good intentions. he befriends luna lovegood (another one of my favorite characters in all of fiction)  gives of himself to others  and is willing to suffer so that others won't have to experience the same pain. in other words  harry loves."

(which i have only given to the first book in this series.)'            'god  how do you talk about this book? it’s really amazing. it is really hard for me to feel anything while reading a book '  or generally living my life  '. for example  i felt nothing when sirius died. nothing throughout most of this series  actually. and nothing in this book  because nothing happened and everyone survived and everything is sunshiney and joyful!'            'ugh. i tried. the last hundred-ish pages of this book really tore me apart. okay  even that’s not true. i’ll just come out and say it: i’m really f*cking sad that dumbledore died. i love him so much. he’s high up in my top 5 characters. (do i even have a top 5?) i’m devastated  which makes me even more upset  because i have a life to live today and can’t just lay around and wallow in fictional pain.'            'i’m going to move on in the hopes that i just. forget. because i don’t like this at all.'            'here  we see harry potter - who  i think few will argue  has been a fairly mediocre character up to this point - become amazing. he’s motivated solely by his need to work against injustice and evil. he realizes his parents’ legacy within himself. he denounces the sucking up of others. he works hard in school! he is a good friend even when his two bffs are being childish to one another plus refusing to believe him. in short  he’s really  really  five-star-level great here. gorgeous character development in 650 pages.'            'i didn’t think i liked ginny much  because i didn’t remember this book well...like  at all. but she is so great! so funny. i wish there was more of her in this book.'            "also  i’ll fight anyone who says dumbledore is ~the real villain~ of this series. he’s really not. (cough  snape is  cough.) and you're not edgy  people who hate dumbledore but love snape. you're just dumb. i fell deeply in love with the guy. (dumbledore  not snape. bleh.) and i f*cking miss him. goddamn it. trying to forget didn’t last very long. anyway."            'i missed hermione and neville. hermione was absolutely not well-represented here at all. maybe it’s a good thing she’s not a ravenclaw (#ravenclawpride) because she works fully against logic throughout this book. and when she’s not she just  like  refuses to believe harry.'            'ron is soooooooooo annoying! is he anyone’s favorite character? he’s like  fred or george if one of them was totally childish and attention-starved and mean. in fact  ronald is a pretty impressive character for the number of gross character traits he embodies despite being supposed to be a good character. mean  immature  rude  jealous  definition of an inferiority complex. bleh.'            'harry and ginny i’m totally for  but the other relationships in this book are so boring. can we do hermione and fred instead? ron and luna would be cute. or  god forbid  some lgbt representation? we know you’re a supporter  joanne. don’t even get me started on lupin and tonks.'            'speaking of supposedly-good characters’ downfalls: i’m no longer a hagrid fan. it started with the last book and came fully around here. like  at a certain point  the man needs a character trait. liking weird animals  making bad food  and being humongous don’t count. harry and hermione’s constant stubbornness is annoying. plus makes the plot repetitive once in a while. also  tonks. you know what  i guess i am going to get started on lupin and tonks! she was a hilarious badass in the last book  totally depressed and weak in this one. i know i sound like a total emotionless asshole here  but that’s who i am  and she’s annoying in this book. and it’s totally fine because she’s just being a spineless idiot over some dumb shabby man. kill me  please. '  then i can see my beloved dumbledore again.            'too much snape. (cannot wait to write the rant on him.) too much draco. (why do people romanticize that little weirdo so much? i guess i get the temptation  but he’s a bully at best and a spineless traitor at worst.) i hate kreacher and i hate dobby...i hated winky  too...i might hate house elves. if that makes me racist against a species of fictional character  so be it  i guess.'            'i miss fred and george  and the fun people from the order (if they existed)  and hermione and neville aren’t here nearly enough. the price of harry’s amazing and concise character development is way too many bad characters  not nearly enough of the good ones. except dumbledore. ughhhh. i’m so sad. (i think my inability to cry is making this worse. maybe if i just creepily sobbed in front of my roommate for a few minutes i’d feel better. damn you  my lack of emotions! just kidding love you.)'            'but i want to give this book five stars more than anything. it was so compulsively readable  more than any other book since the first for me. and it’s the last book where our pals are attending hogwarts. that makes me so sad. it’s such a gorgeous setting and i’m going to miss it so much. why is this book so sad?! if deathly hallows is any sadder i’ll be seriously impressed. and also seriously screwed.'            'and  okay  even though i was a harsh critic of these books...i’m really going to miss this series. i’ve been rereading it on and off (obviously) for three months  and it’s been a fun ride. this is one of the greatest settings of all time. and since i’m rereading it after 10 years  it’s like saying goodbye twice. and i hate endings.'            'bottom line: okay  this is my favorite harry potter book. (anyone else’s?) unreal character development + tragic and lovely adieu to a gorgeous setting + ability to make me feel real  deep emotion + compulsively readable? an absolute dream.'

'it\'s also the reason why i\'m not rushing to reread the following book given the frustrations whenever an author dismisses the actions of an evil character  like snape  for "oh  love..." you\'ve painted your picture for the whole series  making us not only hate but '  despise  ' severus snape  so you can\'t just drop this pent-up anger with one scene in the seventh book. snape "loving" (more like  marking his territory) a certain someone who chooses not to settle for him doesn\'t justify his following actions  no matter what storyline tries to redeem him.'      '• the one thing that really settled with me was when harry and dumbledore were discussing\xa0destiny and "the\xa0prophecy" and how it\'s neither here nor there: voldemort sculpted his own enemy  by choosing to believe that prophecy he molded you into his enemy. i listened to a lecture on the topic that voiced a similar idea that in order for there to be good in the world there needs to be evil to defeat.'      “imagine  please  just for a moment  that you had never heard that prophecy! how would you feel about voldemort now? think!’    harry watched dumbledore striding up and down in front of him  and thought. he thought of his mother  his father and sirius. he thought of cedric diggory. he thought of all the terrible deeds he knew lord voldemort had done. a flame seemed to leap inside his chest  searing his throat.    ‘i’d want him finished ’ said harry quietly. ‘and i’d want to do it.’    ‘of course you would!’ cried dumbledore. ‘you see  the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! but the prophecy caused lord voldemort to mark you as his equal ... in other words  you are free to choose your way  quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! but voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy. he will continue to hunt you ... which makes it certain  really  that -‘    ‘that one of us is going to end up killing the other ’ said harry. ‘yes.’”      "• the main plot-propelling point is circling around the pensieve  which at the time of reading i found so fascinating and wondered what memories i would store away. however brilliant the first memory from bob ogden  sooner than later these flashbacks start feeling like a contrived set up for a grander plot-device  especially when dumbledore speaks like he's looking through a crystal ball; professor trelawney seems tame in comparison."      “why?’ said harry at once  looking up into dumbledore’s face. ‘why did he come back? did you ever find out?’    ‘i have ideas ’ said dumbledore  ‘but no more than that.’    ‘what ideas  sir?’    ‘i shall tell you  harry  when you have retrieved that memory from professor slughorn ’ said dumbledore. ‘when you have that last piece of the jigsaw  everything will  i hope  be clear ... to both of us.”      "this was so defeating to read the first time  being held on a leash with the information that could be released  but on this reread  knowing what's ahead  i could relax and take in all the suspense and foreshadowing."      "• it's unfortunate  though  that the author deems all these important adult figures in harry's life valuable only long enough to serve him in the grand scheme of things. children need adults to look up to for longer than a semester period. i noticed that even when i was having a good time reading  half-way through a thought would creep in to remind me that half of the characters wouldn’t survive this series... and then it felt somehow wrong to laugh at something they said."      '•which leads me to discuss the one thing that i dreaded and put-off... '          "i'd forgotten that rereading harry potter and the half-blood prince meant reliving this emotional trauma of a chapter all-over again. i honestly can't believe i got fooled twice into believing that snape would come to heal dumbledore. i was utterly and positively assured that when severus snape came running down towards dumbledore it was to cure him of his wounds. my brain somehow managed to repress the memory of that scene and fooled me into believing the same damn thing i thought the very first time... evidently  the events of this series have all mixed into one for me so that certain scenes from the last book i expect to show up in here. though nothing prepared me for this line that broke everything:"      
‘i am not worried  harry ’ said dumbledore  his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. ‘i am with you.’
      "if nothing else  i'll certainly miss his sage sayings:"    



      ‘dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right ’ said hermione.

book review

    '4 out of 5 stars to '  harry potter and the half-blood prince  '  the 6th book in the young adult fantasy series written in 2005 by '  j.k. rowling  ". although i could go on and on about this book  there are so many other reviews and reviewers who are likely to have a better one simply because they wrote it write after reading the book or watching the movie. i read it close to ten years ago  saw the movie at least 5 years ago  and though i would love to re-read them... my tbr pile is way too high. that said... it's a fantastic series full of wild imagination  great beauty and intricate sentiment. in this book  harry must connect with the past and his dark side  trying to figure out who this half-blood prince is... and when he finds out  everything is different. the book is about relationships... discovering things about yourself and others that you didn't know. and when someone harry absolutely adores is murdered right in front of him  and it's connected with the half-blood prince  it sends harry on a downward spiral  out of control  but necessary for him to find the inner strength to fight lord voldemort. i can't even begin to write a review for this book... let's just go get some coffee or a drink and talk about it. it requires us having an animated conversation... right?"

'    'a darker book than any in the series thus far with a level of sophistication belying its genre  harry potter and the half-blood prince moves the series into murkier waters and marks the arrival of rowling onto the adult literary scene. while she has long been praised for her cleverness and wit  the strength of book 6 lies in her subtle development of key characters  as well as her carefully nuanced depiction of a community at war. in harry potter and the half-blood prince  no one and nothing is safe  including preconceived notions of good and evil and of right and wrong. with each book in her increasingly remarkable series  fans have nervously watched j.k. rowling raise the stakes; gone are the simple delights of butterbeer and enchanted candy  and days when the worst ailment could be cured by a bite of chocolate. a series that began as a colorful lark full of magic and discovery has become a dark and deadly war zone. but this should not come as a shock to loyal readers. rowling readied fans with '  harry potter and the goblet of fire  ' and '  harry potter and the order of the phoenix  ' by killing off popular characters and engaging the young students in battle. still  there is an unexpected bleakness from the start of book 6 that casts a mean shadow over quidditch games  silly flirtations  and mountains of homework. ready or not  the tremendous ending of harry potter and the half-blood prince will leave stunned fans wondering what great and terrible events await in book 7 if this sinister darkness is meant to light the way.'

  ' ']["                        my heart is shattering as i finish this phenomenal book. i was nervous to read it again because as it was my favourite the first time i read the series  i was anxious to see if maybe i would be let down. i completely understand why this was my favourite of the series  and still so far is. i connect the most with the characters and the feelings that they are faced with throughout this book. i am bawling my eyes out as i write this review  and with good reason. the death of dumbledore is earth shattering  and the grave nature of this situation is delivered perfectly. this book is the darkest  i believe  of the series  as voldemort's reign begins to take place. the fear  and frustration is eminent throughout every word; however  there is lightheartedness throughout. delving into voldemort's past is one of the unique aspects portrayed in this book. it's incredibly fascinating to learn the history of the darkest wizard of all time. there is so much we learn  and so much more we can guess about him  which is the sign of a great writer. j.k. rowling allows the reader to figure things out on their own and take their own ideas from what she gives. it is impossible to lose interest as you discover more and more of this story. however  the biggest and most prominent reason of why this book speaks to me so deeply is because of draco malfoy. this is his story  his book  no matter how many ways one can look at it. he is so complex  very smart  troubled  hurt  confused  misunderstood  but nevertheless  strong in his beliefs. he loves his family and will do anything to protect them. something that i didn't notice the first time i read the books  which i can see now  is that draco is skilled at hiding his thoughts from intruders  which means that he is skilled in occlumency. i adore him and it's crazy how one can learn so many things about their favourite character that they didn't know before just by paying attention to detail. this chills me to my core. i connect with him on so many levels  and although this is odd to many people  because they see him as a villain  he is not  and i truly respect him with everything i have. he knows love  perhaps more than even harry  as he is willing to do what it takes to protect his family. he deserves a chance  just like so many others  as there are many layers to his character. there is so much that i can say about him  but i will keep it at that. i will always cherish this story with all my might. this book destroys me in the best possible ways.

"      "in contrast  since dumbledore understands that harry's faults and weakness are made up for by his two friends  he encourages harry to share everything he learns with them. hermione is exceptionally brilliant and cautious  while ron is brave and has tons of practical common sense. hermione and ron help balance out harry's often reckless  undisciplined  how-i-feel-at-this-moment-is-all-that-matters brain. they have learned to rely on each other and listen even if they don't always agree. this has created a very strong bond of fierce loyalty  responsibility  and obligation. "      'even ron and hermione\'s constant skepticism of harry\'s ideas throughout this book is an indication of how great this friendship is. as seen in books 1-5  harry\'s ideas are sometimes right and sometimes horribly  horribly wrong. these friends don\'t take "the chosen one" at his word. they challenge him and question him. they aren\'t just along for the ride. they are in it to freaking win it. together.'

"as the book progresses  it becomes increasingly apparent that defeating voldemort will be an exceptionally difficult task. however  it has been emphasized over and over again throughout the entire series that it will take teamwork to rid the world of evil. in the sorcerer's stone  none of the 3 by themselves could have made it through each of the tasks leading up to finding the stone. in the chamber of secrets  each of them again played an important role in destroying the first horcrux (which didn't die easily  by the way)  along with the crucial assistance of a phoenix and a hat. in the prisoner of azkaban  what in the world would have happened if any of the 3 had not taken part? in the goblet of fire  harry would have never gotten through the tournament if the others hadn't help him learn the necessary skills. in the order of the phoenix  harry would have died for sure in the dept of mysteries without the d.a. and in this book  we find that dumbledore himself acted rashly with the second horcrux (which also didn't die easily  by the way)  and that this man  perhaps the greatest wizard who ever lived  couldn't have retrieved horcrux #3 without a second person being there to help. "      'when harry realizes what he has to do at the end of the book  ron and hermione quickly  calmly  and unselfishly insist that they will leave their families and their education and go with him whether he likes it or not. harry sets out on this nearly impossible task with no army except his two soulmates  which might give him a fighting chance against a man with an army of evil but no soul.

'there are teenage romances at hogwarts and the usual sorting out of emotional turmoil associated with mid adolescence'    "harry potter's feelings for ron's lovely flame haired sister ginny is growing  and ron himself is dating lavender brown (somewhat 'air headed' and silly but i've always has a soft spot for lavender) which causes tension between ron and hermione."

"also harry potter comes into ownership on a book on potions that was once owned by a mysterious 'half blood prince' which gives his powerful and vast knowledge  invaluable to his magical education and growth of his powers."

"if you're a fan of dumbledore  this book will both please and infuriate you. he's in more scenes than ever while he gives harry private lessons  showing both his and other people's memories  all leading to a fascinating backstory focusing on voldemort. you don't actually get to see the monstrous villain in this book - you only hear about him  which is typical of the earlier installments. there's a few death eaters popping up though  including fenrir  a new big-bad i hadn't noticed before  a demented werewolf of all things. can i just say this guy is actually creepy? especially his focus on hurting and turning children."      "as always these books are impossible to put down  since rowling's writing technique not only rocks  but she gives us unique characters who are individuals standing out from each other while working toward standing together unified. rowling always introduces a new stand-out character in books; here it's a new potions master who enjoys fame and getting to know students who he has determined are 'going places.' dumbledore has something else up his sleeve about this teacher  too..."      "pacing wise it's okay  as this book is more of a filler than anything  but it does give us one big revelation concerning voldemort. all the other books pointed toward this  but it's now more obvious coming together when harry sees the larger picture. while a stepping stone to the next book  'the half-blood prince' is in no way boring. you get to see harry with his friends and relationships  a little in the classes and especially wondering who on earth the half-blood prince is. that mystery intrigued me since i couldn't figure it out for awhile  and i'd forgotten since watching the movie years back."      "while the new potions teacher is introduced  snape finally gets his turn at 'defense against the dark arts.' i was slightly bummed we didn't get to see more time spent in his class  however. i've always enjoyed the classroom teaching and experiences in the other books  and here was a chance to see freaking snape of all people talking about the dark arts! unfortunately there's just the one classroom moment. although we don't see too much on the teaching side  snape is still brilliantly constructed and a page-stealer when he comes on scene."
