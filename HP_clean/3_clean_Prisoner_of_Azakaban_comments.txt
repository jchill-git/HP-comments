harry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground beneath him was falling sharply away. he had grown used to the idea that dumbledore could solve anything. he had expected dumbledore to pull some amazing solution out of the air. but no ... their last hope was gone.
  "i know that everyone loves sirius  but for some reason  he didn't click for me when i was 14. this time around  i could understand his character more. i could relate to his desperation  his frustration  and the hope that kept him alive all those excruciating years in azkaban."

'so  i decided to start with the first harry potter book i ever read  the one that took me to hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry  and '  made me believe that magic is something tangible.    

“i solemnly swear that i am up to no good.” 

    'i was 16 years old  and i had just started my english classes in order to pass my proficiency examinations. my teacher told me that the best way to delve into a foreign language and familiarize with it is to read books written in it  so she gave me the third instalment of harry potter. (little did she know that she unleashed a beast who now reads almost exclusively in english). before i tell you about my experience  i need to make a confession. it was my choice to stay away from '  j.k. rowling  '\'s books until that moment. i wanted to swim against the current  and i thought that harry potter was too "mainstream" for my taste. and the foolish little me was proud of this decision. but when my teacher gave me this old  used copy  something inside me cracked. i knew the basics about the story  about the orphan kid who goes to a school for wizards and fights the ugly  evil dude who doesn\'t have a nose. but page by page  i came to understand with awe that the wizard who finds trouble even when he doesn\'t want to offers more than that; '  he opened a portal to a world where i longed to be fervently  ". i stayed up late at night  with a faint light just enough to make out the sentences  and i cheered for gryffindor's quidditch team  i flied with firebolt and i kept wondering what my patronus would be (according to pottermore it's a brown mastiff  which is oddly fitting). i casted spells (but never avada kedavra  you shouldn't play with this shit) and tasted butterbeer in hogsmeade  and just like that  my life had changed irrevocably. i was a potterhead. and i was proud of "  that  ". (my mum wasn't though  especially when i asked for a wand)."    

“happiness can be found  even in the darkest of times  if one only remembers to turn on the light.”

    'there is a reason why '  j.k. rowling  ' is the fairy god-mother to millions of children (and adults) worldwide.

'      'a mass murderer has escaped from prison. the news is so important that it even made the muggle news. even muggles who detest magic like the dursleys are on high alert. for harry potter  a wizard about to enter his third year at hogwarts  it is just another summer vacation. although famous and living up to his name during his first two years at school  at the dursleys he is treated like less than human. his living conditions have advanced from a cupboard under the stairs to a room with bars on the window and a flap on the door for which to receive stone cold meals. even though aunt petunia is harry’s blood relative  she also treats him like vermin. things couldn’t get any worse until uncle vernon’s sister marge arrives for a weeklong visit  and she believes that harry is worthless and ungrateful to his family. what marge fails to realize is that this so called family wishes that harry did not exist. harry’s true family is thicker than blood and bound by magic: his hogwarts family. each summer  life at dursleys grows unbearable and marge’s treatment of harry puts things over the top. in a fit of teenage emotions  harry causes marge to blow up  and then he leaves the dursleys home  for what he thinks is hopefully for good this time. '      'normally use of magic outside of school is grounds for expulsion from school  but  with a murderer named sirius black on the loose  the minister of magic himself has bent the rules in harry’s favor. minister cornelius fudge believes that black is a dark wizard and servant of lord voldemort  and  in his eyes  the safest place for harry is at hogwarts under the watchful eyes of albus dumbledore. harry gets a reprieve and is allowed to spend three weeks of his summer vacation away from the dursleys and will indeed get to return to hogwarts to continue his magical education. with the addition of black to the storyline  the stories only get darker. readers find out that he is the first ever prisoner to escape from azkaban prison located in the middle of the sea and guarded by dementors  creatures so foul that they suck the happy memories from all those around them. fudge is convinced that black is after harry and has stationed dementors outside of hogwarts  much to dumbledore’s chagrin. as long as dumbledore is headmaster  dementors will not be allowed inside the castle because he foresees that these horrid creatures are allied with voldemort. black was able to outsmart them  and all of england is on high alert. it is against this backdrop and protection that harry returns to hogwarts. '      'third year students have more responsibilities and more freedoms. they are allowed to visit the village of hogsmeade provided a parent or guardian signed a form; the dursleys did not. yet  they also have enough magical training to sign up for extra classes. harry  ron  and hermoine enroll in divination and care of magical creatures  taught by none other than hagrid. hermoine also begins the study of ancient runes  arithmancy  and muggle studies. harry and ron do not understand how anyone  even one as smart as hermoine  could take that many classes. some are at the same time as others  which makes it humanly impossible for her to attend two classes at once. the dialogue between ron and hermoine involving her class schedule speaks to growing relationship between the two  a relationship which neither is mature enough to recognize. meanwhile  class work has gotten harder. professor snape loathes harry more than ever  and the new defense of the dark arts professor lupin is an old friend of harry’s father. hagrid  while the nicest person around and harry’s protector  is threatened by the malfoys yet again  this time after draco is scratched by a hippogriff named buckbeak because he refused to pay attention in class. buckbeak is threatened with execution  adding to the animosity between harry and draco  and only hermoine  on top of her grueling class schedule  finds the time to assist hagrid in his defense. all these storylines would make for an exciting tale  but inserting lupin and black and harry’s anti-dementor training make this book the turning point in the entire series. '      'the story progresses  and animals play a key role in plot development: ron’s rat  hermoine’s cat  and a large black dog. the three are infinitely linked to one another. rowling reveals that black was the potters’ secret keeper and only him revealing their whereabouts would expose their location to voldemort. he was supposedly in jail for murdering twelve innocent people plus a tag along named peter pettigrew. he is also harry’s godfather. this information has harry’s growing teenaged emotions on high. he is more determined than ever to defeat voldemort and his legion of dark creatures and takes necessary precautions to guard himself against the darkness. although teenaged pranks occur in this book  my favorite scenes are between harry and lupin and black. being able to interact with one of his parents’ closest friends  one really feels for harry as an orphan and sees that he truly belongs in the wizarding world and not at the dursleys. as rowling will reveal much  much later  dumbledore has his reasons for placing harry there  but with each book it gets harder and harder for him to return  even if the presence of these muggles is key to the plot line. '      'time  of course  plays a key role in the plot as well. hermoine reveals that she has been using a time turner to get to her classes all year but promised not to tell anyone. sirius turns out to be none other than the dog who has made an appearance throughout the book. he is innocent  yet the only people who believe him are harry  ron  hermoine  and professor dumbledore. lupin is indeed his closest friend and also a werewolf  and it is pettigrew who is the servant of lord voldemort. this  dumbledore explains to harry  is magic at its deepest  most impenetrable moments and  in my opinion  the essence of the entire series. as dumbledore points out time and again  it is one’s choices that determine one’s fate  not their abilities. for a few glorious moments harry believes that he can live with sirius and escape the dursleys once and for all; it is the most touching moment  and the scene in the movie where the two of them are staring at hogwarts castle has brought tears to my eyes on more than one occasion. yet  this moment is indeed fleeting. the ministry of magic still believes that sirius is a dark wizard and he is forced to flee on buckbeak the innocent hippogriff. readers know that this moment is indeed fleeting because harry and sirius will eventually be reunited but for only a short amount of time. it makes for a necessary storyline later on but one that gets harder and harder to stomach with each passing reading. pretending that i do not know what comes next; however  knowing that sirius and lupin reappear in future books is what has always had me excited at the end of this book  a crossroads between the end of harry’s adolescence and the darker times that lurk on the horizon. '      'time. j.k. rowling has shown us what can happen if well meaning witches and wizards are given just a few hours extra in their days. most adults with busy lives wish they were afforded the opportunity to relive hours and minutes in order to accomplish even the most mundane tasks. the climax of this book has revealed how precious time is and to take advantage of what time we do have in order to live life to the fullest. this year’s leap day provided me with the opportunity to reread favorite books and get some much needed rest that i needed after a busy week. even in this busy life that i lead  i have found the time to visit harry potter’s magical world yet again. as the plot moves deeper into harry’s teenaged years  and  he and his friends are about to embark on fighting the forces of evil  it is obvious that they have left their childhood behind. it is the moments that mark the end of this book combined with the extra time afforded to us this year that show us just how precious the time we have is to us all.

'crookshanks swished his tail back and forth as he crept up the stairs to the boys\' bedrooms. he knew the rat wasn\'t what it was pretending to be  but all of his attempts to alert the humans to this fact had failed. "i don\'t know why i even bother " he muttered to himself. "i could get along fine without any of them. let the rat do whatever it is it\'s trying to do. so long as girl keeps feeding me and scratching my belly  i\'ll - hello  what\'s this?"'      "he could smell the rat. its scent was like nothing crookshanks had ever smelled  and for all his time living in a magical pet shop  he'd smelled a lot. the rat did smell like a rat  yes  but there was also something else. something... human. it was just like that big black dog he'd met on the grounds the other day. every instinct in him had screamed to run away  but there was that smell. and even crookshanks knew what they said about cats and curiosity. the dog had turned out to be more than just a dog  and it had convinced crookshanks to help it. first order of business: retrieve a certain rat from the bedroom of the red-haired boy."      "the boy wasn't in  but the rat was. crookshanks circled the bed a few times. this time  maybe  he would be able to get the damn thing. he tensed for a moment and then leapt onto the bed."      'by luck or skill  he was nearly on top of the thing when he landed. "a-ha!" he yowled. "gotcha!" he pinned the rat under his sizable paw. "where you gonna run to now  ratty?" he asked  sneering as best he could.'      'the rat writhed in his grip. "please " it said. "just let me go. you don\'t know what will happen if you eat me  it would be a terrible mistake!"'      '"a mistake  eh?" the cat said. "we\'ll see about that. i have a great big doggie friend who\'s just aching to get his jaws around you...."'      "he barely had time to finish his sentence when the rat went mad. it squealed and bit and slashed with its paws. and then  against all of crookshanks' previous experience - it grew! it nearly threw the cat off the bed as it became much more massive - its legs lengthened and its arms stretched until it had reached a human size and shape. crookshanks goggled. of all the things he'd expected from this rat  this wasn't it. the human grabbed at him  but crookshanks was too fast. he jumped off the bed and shimmied under the wardrobe  where he could see but not be seen."      'the human looked around  breathing heavily. he was pale and thin  and still looked ratty. "think  peter  think " he said. "gotta get out of here  but..." he stopped  glanced at the wardrobe  and grimaced. "you may just have given me my way out  cat " he said. and then he bit the ball of his hand.'      'blood dripped out  leaving spreading red blotches on the sheets. "they\'ll think it was you " he said. "they\'ll leave me for dead and i\'ll be free to rejoin my lord." he looked at the recently repaired curtains on ron\'s bed. "it\'s not safe here anymore." he sucked at the wound to stop the bloodflow and then went to the window. perched on the windowsill  he looked over at crookshanks\' hiding place. "if i were human " he said  "the fall would kill me. but as a rat...." his body rippled and twisted and shrank  and then there was an old grey rat on the sill. crookshanks was pretty sure it winked at him before leaping off.'      'after a minute or two  crookshanks wriggled out from under the wardrobe  his thoughts dark. the red-haired boy was going to be angry  and so was the girl. but more importantly  the dog was going to be furious. it was barely holding on to its sanity as it was. crookshanks shook his head. this was going to get worse before it would get better...

'i feel about snape the way michael scott feels about toby. but i digress. my main thing with this book is that rowling can be kind of...bad at fitting the parameters of the universe she created. that’s understandable  since it’s immense and so impressive  but there’s also little common sense things that get under my skin. (this would be under “general stupidity” if i hated this book - which i absolutely don’t.) i wanted to be having a great time  but instead i was caught up in the little mistakes.'            'some examples: there’s just no way mcgonagall would have given hermione the time turner. no way. i get the significance of the thing to the plot  and it’s a really creative and entertaining concept  but my girl minerva would never have handed that over. this is the woman who will shut any student down  take harry potter’s broom  deduct points from her own team  throw shade at trelawney...what i’m saying is she’s a one hundred percent badass. and she’s a badass who exudes said badassery with the well-being of all hogwarts students in mind. but i’m supposed to believe she put herself out there  petitioned the government  and presumably put in effort to convince her fellow faculty just so hermione could take a purely overwhelming number of classes? nah. she would have recognized it as unnecessary (hermione never even gives a reason beyond "wanting to" for her overloaded schedule) and a huge pressure (workload\'s making a thirteen year old cry all the time and lose the ability to sleep). in other words  minerva would have shut that shit down in a hot texas minute.'            'but wait - i have more examples! lupin tells us that when he was at hogwarts  they went through an insane amount of work to get him off the grounds when he ~underwent his transformation~. keep in mind this whole thing is for one. effing. student. they put in a magic  violent tree (the infamous whomping willow)  dig a tunnel that is presumably at least a mile or two long  and mess with (build?) a shack-like shelter. this is way  way  way too much to ensure that a single student can attend the school. but even suspending your disbelief there - why would you put a werewolf inside a weak  shut up building to protect people? one  don’t put a rabid monstrous creature in a house  because two  he can break out of it and now the inhabitants of hogsmeade are at risk. also  putting in the whomping willow? are you kidding me? it’s a danger to the students! and so is building a passageway in/out. there are so  so  so many more problems than solutions here.'

'the sheer confusion of the story relayed in the shrieking shack was also so confusing. like  i get why there had to be a dozen f*cking pages of black/lupin begging the story to be told and hermione/ron/harry essentially covering their ears and singing “walking on sunshine ” but they couldn’t at least have told the story with some semblance of organization once they finally got there? i mean  jesus.'

 the importance of keeping happy memories in hand
  ' ....'        my patrounas is a cat  thought that was obvious :)      
***chapter thirteen***quidditch never been more exciting.
    "they didn't have a complete quidditch season in both book one and book two.. did you noticed so? or even cared with everything going on every end of the previous two years? i don't think so. "  (-i had to look it up online why gryffindor didn't won for 9 years  it was 7 in the first book  and i find out that the internet already full with that question -and good answer seekers :)-)        "but it's oliver wood  our beloved gryffindor quidditch captain’s last year in hogwarts   so it matters now."    'and with the grim defeat few chapters ago  this chapter with gryffindor vs ravenclaw was really exciting.'    'till the cliffhanger end.'        oh forget  did you noticed that cho chang a year older than harry?      
*** chapter fourteen ***“your father did something snape could never forgive.”“what?”“he saved his life.”
-harry potter and the philosopher's stone
    'since book one ever wondered how? sure we did...'    "here's a finally  2 years later  a glimpse of how did harry’s father saved snape’s life... yet still snape isn't grateful as you might think."          
*** chapter fifteen ***the quidditch really matter in this book.
    'guess i already told you so....it is since the first game of the year..'        'first time to behold the cup.. '  (only later in book 5 will do again  oh the symmetry.)      
*** chapter sixteen ***exams
    'i always love the "exams" chapter in every book  though it\'s mostly hasty   just summing up all the exams... so i always wish to have more of it.'        "trelawney makes her second accurate prediction... but we don't know that yet  only later in this book.."    "oh and you'll never know what was her first untill much later in book five (again  which is book three symmetry twin.)"    'oh... and here we say goodbye -maybe- to buckbeak.'        'but....that what was the trigger to the climax of the book..'      
*** chapter seventeen ***cat  rat and dog
    "look  no matter how exciting the re-reads of harry potter.. i can't never forget the chill i got first time i read this couple of chapters.."

*** chapter nineteen ***..-servant of lord voldemort
        'god  a huge revelation that back to the night when harry’s parents got betrayed and killed..  and how harry got his ride in the motorcycle with hagrid is finally shown in full and clear in the story...'    (oh yes  black been mentioned from the very early beginning..remember?
“borrowed it  professor dumbledore  sir ”said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. “young sirius black lent it to me. i’ve got him  sir.”-harry potter and the philosopher's stone)    'and the climax chapters end tragically wrong with..-'    
*** chapter twenty ***-..dark night despite the full moon.
    'very dark chapter indeed.'        'now  take a breath..'    'remember back when we first read these chapters made us thought that crockshanks might be harry’s father? god  that was wild.'    (i remember many theories that kept growing till before the release of book 7 that he's actually alive.)    "also now we get it that the sneakoscope   that harry got at the beginning of this book as a present from ron  wasn't malfunctioned after all.."  (scrabbers was there..dah!)    well  i'd do anything to get a time machine so i'd go back and read this mystery all over again with the same excitement and awe i felt with every twist.  'but why buy a complicated time machine when we have...-'      
*** chapter twenty one ***-..hermione’s secret   the time turner.
    'here where you re-read the climax of the novel  but in'   'back in time'   "mode.. and they didn't change anything... everything already happened!"        'i loved the little perfect rules rowling did for this twist..'    technically they didn't change fate... nothing happened have been changed. i just love that.    'i always love the time stories..'  (and this beautiful illustration)        "but sure it's a tricky plot."    'and rowling herself regretted doing it later cause always fans -probably herself too  even the characters in her wizardry world- would ask what if we used a time turner for this or that...'    'she tried in book five'   (symmetry twin)  ' to close the matter of time turners..but not until '  the cursed child  ' that it closed once and for all.'        "well  i believe that's why i will always appreciate it no matter how the hates it get from many fans."      
*** chapter twenty two (the last) ***symmetry
    'and always the last chapter symmetrically with the first..'    'these little things from every chapter even the first must be concluded here..'    'sometimes last chapters makes me widely smile.. or have teary eyes -as in the next book- but mostly smile..'    'remember that the dursley already watched black in the news?'    'ron is pet-less....after the whole cat/rat struggle the whole year..'

“i solemnly swear that i am up to no good.”
      as a side note  this review has no order and is literally just me rambling abt my thoughts throughout reading the book. so i apologize in advance if my review is a mess. i'm sorry as i am still shook at everything that went down in the ending.      'the ending has left me shook. '  
shook.
  ' guys  '  shook.  " i just can't function properly rn. like  my brain is still trying to process all the information. everything that went down with sirius black  professor lupin  peter pettigrew  harry  ron  hermione  and snape like omg. how scabbers was rlly pettigrew this whole time and that sirius wasn't the potters' secret-kepper and how the four of them  black  lupin  pettigrew  and potter  wrote the freaking map. and how they illegally made themselves change into animals. and omfg that one chapter when black was surrounded by the dementors and how they were on the verge of performing the kiss on them but harry stopped them in time with his spell and i kid you not guys  i repeat  i kid you not  i freaking had tears in my eyes. my friends were looking at me like i lost my damn mind. like i'm not even joking with you. i cried b/c well  obviously black is innocent and i rlly didn't want him to die  especially when he offered to have harry move in with him instead of the dursley's. like  he can't die b/c he's freaking harry's godfather. and he bought harry the firebolt as a birthday present and he signed the permission slip for harry to go to hogsmeade like bro  everyone is hella wrong abt black and he's just such an amazing person to harry and is nothing everyone thinks he is. i swear  i hope he's ok and that everything gets cleared up b/c i rlly want him to be ok and not have to be in hiding anymore."      "and hermione's secret?! she's been going back in time with the little hourglass and how at the end  she and harry went back in time and was able to save buckbeak "  and  " sirius black. like bro  i'm shook. and like dumbledore was in on hermione and harry going back in time and how he willingly let sirius black go even though there isn't sufficient evidence that he is  in fact  not guilty. this goes to show that dumbledore truly is a wonderful man. "      
“mr. moony presents his compliments to professor snape  and begs him to keep his abnormally large nose out of other people's business.mr. prongs agrees with mr. moony  and would like to add that professor snape is an ugly git.mr. padfoot would like to register his astonishment that an idiot like that ever became a professor.mr. wormtail bids professor snape good day  and advises him to wash his hair  the slimeball.” 
      "k so going back to pettigrew  like screw him and i hated that he escaped. he better die a horrible death and rot in hell. b/c if he doesn't die and rot in hell  he's gonna have a meeting with my fist. "      "professor lupin ends up resigning as defense against the dark arts teacher and i'm just sad. it's not his fault that snape is a freaking bastard. i hated how he had to leave his job. he rlly fit the role and i can't bear to see him leave. all the students obviously loved him and enjoyed his lessons and the fact that he has to leave now that everyone knows he can transform into a wolf and is a danger to everyone just breaks my heart.

“what you fear most of all is —fear. very wise...”
      "so this is like smth i can't ever forget  but hermione legit slapped malfoy in the face for being rude and saying harsh things abt hagrid. like gurl  you go! i 100% was not expecting that and when it happened  i laughed b/c that seems like smth she wouldn't ever do and like wow  just shook me. "      "omg and harry's crush on the ravenclaw's seeker: cho chang. "  "harry couldn't help noticing  nervous as he was  that she was extremely pretty. she smiled at harry as the teams faced each other behind their captains  and he felt a slight lurch in the region of his stomach that he didn't think had anything to do with nerves."  " bro  harry got game! like this here is making me hyperventilate. it's not rlly dirty  but it's dirty to me omg. "      
“the ones who love us never really leave us  you can always find them in here.” 
      "of course  how could i forget? that epic save harry did to catch the seeker in their final game against slytherin. like i was so happy and excited for gryffindor and i just can't omg. "      "i almost forgot. the marauder's map. this map is hella cool. i want one of these maps so badly! "      "k so i'm done and that ending  like omg my brain might explode. "

            re-read -   " only the quidditch scenes earned five stars from me. this book is epic. suffice to say that harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban is the best of the series. the story gets darker and more complex than the previous books. harry  ron and hermiome don't chase the clue this time  they have to find a way to guard their lives from the most horrendous prisoner  sirius black."

(isn\'t it weird how on rereads  when we know what\'s coming  it doesn\'t lessen the blow and hurt of heartbreaking events?). the reason why i was so bereft at the end of this was just the thought of harry thinking that he finally had a "home" - not the living situation he has had with the dursleys since the death of his parents  but an actual home - and then it quickly being snatched away again. so i was getting all upset over this until he gets his letter from sirius and then... his permission slip to go to hogsmeade and all of a sudden it was happy tears running down my face. hp hitting me with the feels!'      'i also always suffer from major feels when there\'s any reference to harry\'s parents. hearing sirius or remus tell harry that he is like his father  or for dumbledore to say that his father is always within him and that "prongs rode again last night"  there is no doubt that an emotional breakdown will ensue. i also get weirdly emotional when it comes to any woes that hagrid must face (wtf is wrong with me)  the entire buckbeak storyline had me sad and anxious (again  even though i knew the outcome). a personal highlight of this book is when harry and ron have fallen out with hermione and hagrid feels like he needs to step in and mend bridges  telling them how hurt hermione is by it all. hagrid  you deserve all the good things in life     "this book also had so many funny parts - the phone conversation between ron and mr dursley at the beginning  watching hermione struggling with all her subjects and losing her cool a number of times and so forth  draco dressing up as dementor to scare harry... oh  and hermione punching malfoy in the face!! yasss girl. usually i don't condone violence  but malfoy was being extra dickheady at that point. i also love the time travel aspect and the marauder's map discovery - so much cool stuff in this book."

'       so in a unique part of the review from me  here are all the amazing parts of this book that i forgot because i've been watching the movies instead:       -peeves the poltergeist:  " holy crap how did i forget about this hilarious menacing spirit? he's not as present in this book but he has always had a part in the series and i completely forgot he existed! i know they can't include everything in the movies but i wish peeves had been included."      -charlie weasley:  ' ron had yet another sibling that is only mentioned in the films! this one is the cool brother in egypt.'      -cho chang and cedric diggory:  " there are soooooo many mentions of cho and cedric in this book! i never really noticed cedric until the 4th book where he becomes prominent. and this is the book where harry's crush on cho began. stomach flutters!"      -more details on whomping willow/shrieking shack:  " this may be a spoiler for those of you who haven't read it  but the whomping willow was actually planted to hide lupin's werewolfism as well as the shrieking shack to hide him. i thought this little tidbit was super interesting  along with the details of how black escaped azkaban. "            "and just in general  i love jk rowling's ability to tie things together. there's so much in this book that becomes important later and tiny little details and sharp wit that make me giggle. "            "so in a small factoid  this book is probably my least favorite of the entire series. it's good  obviously  but for some reason i like all the other ones better. the movie  well it's my second to last favorite (just ahead of that godawful goblet of fire film which ruined everything but i digress). the movie director added so many unnecessary things that weren't in the book  and i wish he hadn't so he could of kept the good stuff! (and i've heard a rumor that he didn't even read the fucking book until jk kept vetoing all of his weird ideas. look it up!)"

' ']["                        finally  back to my favourite characters of all time! i started this series almost an year ago. after reading two and half books  i left it. because at that time i was new to reading books and i used to get afraid of long novels. but now i am good with them. so i again started this series a month ago. i am so happy now that i can't tell! harry  ron  hagrid  "

"so i decided it's time to read harry potter  at least the first three to meet sirius black. after eating out the heads of potterheads for 70% of the book  i was out of my mind. i was angry. can you blame me? i was reading the book to meet my bbf and he was nowhere to be seen. i wanted us to spend some quality time together  know each other but i lost hope. nothing could be done in last 15-20% to redeem him."

" there is something in reading these books once again when i am older knowing the full length of sadness i would feel  by knowing the end for most of the characters in the series. with full acknowledgement that despite few who find reprieve here ultimately becomes collateral damage in the end. so many essential characters are introduced here  some minor and some very important for the story to proceed. this book has managed to score the highest among the series mainly due to introducing some of characters that have managed to stay in my favorite character list  sirius and remus. now knowing their bond with james and the lengths they would go for their best friend's son  pains me. suddenly a kind of sadness that i had never felt before  managed to overtake me. specially thinking back to the bygone days of prongs  padfoot  moony and even wormtail  who spent their teenage years dreaming of a future for all four of them  dreaming of growing old together. it occurred to me to imagine what they would have felt when making the marauder's map. maybe they were thinking of the legacy of mischief makers they've leave  not knowing the grim future for them. it is just so sad to imagine  these cheerful  mischievous children  that by the end of the series  all gone  to save each other  not themselves. all died selflessly (mind you i am not including peter pettigrew). these thoughts kept running through me. the futures of all of them lost. if the prophecy was not made  they would have lived better lives. yet  if he-who-must-not-be-named was not sent away because of the actions of prophecy  they still would have died. at least they would have died knowing there was someone for them  one of the three. "      "in a way  this is children's novel but the implications of the story are greater. despite being a children's novel the realistic points of the plot which do go hand-in-hand with tyrannical rulers in the world is quite interesting. for us  whatever is happening to others in the world is merely passing information on the 8 o'clock news but in reality it is the cruel reality to some. many suffer faiths like this  losing parents  losing loved ones  losing whole futures and the repercussions that follow that. it is not with any joy that i bring about such harsh words in such a simple review but i felt that we should remember  what truly matters. insensitivity should not be encouraged and we should not take what we have for granted."

'- the guards at azkaban told fudge that sirius talks in his sleep. but in '  goblet of fire  "  we learn that the only guards at azkaban are the dementors. i've done some research and there is still so much we don't know about those creatures! i'd be very interested to learn how they're able to communicate. "    '------------------'    're-read november 2015'      "it took me over a month to read this  because i have been so busy with college. it definitely got in the way of my reading experience  but i loved poa nonetheless! it has been two or three years since i've read it and i forgot so much! "      "my only complaint is that there were a lot of references to events in previous books. she explained quidditch again  told us who ron and hermione are  what happened at the end of last school year... and to me  that wasn't necessary."      "there are some differences between the film and book (not as many as the later books/films though)  but i don't really mind! the film is my absolute favourite  i like the changes they've made (expect for leaving out information about the marauders) so i don't really know which one i actually prefer :) "      "jk rowling really needs to come out with a prequel asap! i love this book so much because of the marauders  and i wish we knew more about them and their era. i think we can all agree that we'd prefer a prequel over a sequel  such as the cursed child. and yes  i know about fantastic beasts  but that's not really potter related so that doesn't count ;)          "]
