second read review
  ' '      "this book was so much fun! and i honestly enjoyed it more than the first time i read it. i didn't know how much i forgot about this book until i reread it  so i probably enjoyed it very much because i mostly forgot many things in this book. so there are also some things that i want to talk about  "      
 gilderoy lockhart 
  ' '      'he was so annoying and irked me so much. especially in the scene where he set loose of pixies in defence against the dark arts class and he couldn\'t even fix this mess! and told harry  ron and hermione to put them back in the cage and he left them  i was like " what the hell? " he\'s so unbelievable. but i must admit that he made me laugh like in the duelling club  he was disarmed by snape and that scene was so funny until i laughed out loud. '      "i disliked him very much for lying about those stories! he's such a liar. ugh. oh and he deserved what he got in the end that he lost his memory because ron's wand backfired at him. "      
hermione granger
      "i was shocked when i realized that hermione liked lockhart. that guy was so annoying. maybe he was charming but he didn't even know any useful spells  like when harry broke his arm  he conjured a spell and that spell caused harry to lose his bones in his arm! he just made it worse instead of helping him. "      'and even though i was shocked  i also laughed when i knew that hermione put a get well card from lockhart under her pillow when she was in the hospital wing hahahahaha. i guess she really liked him. that scene was just so funny. 😂😂'       well  overall i really enjoyed re-reading this book and i'm going to read the third book now! bye! ❤️      '••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••'        edit : rounded it up into 5 stars      review to come on saturday! ^^      4.8 stars       
" it is our choice  harry  that show what we truly are  far more than our abilities "
      'okay guys  before i started reviewing this book  i wanted to tell you something. '    "this saturday  i read this book until 04:30 am and i completely didn't realise that i was reading for 4 hours or so and on that same day i had an economy course with my teacher and i completely forgot about that too until my mom reminded me of it. the course started at 10:00 am o'clock and i woke up at 11:00 am and maybe i'll get into a little bit trouble when i'm coming to school on monday because of this. but i really couldn't help it! this book was so good and i could not stop reading it!!"    ' '        "okay now let's talking about this book! "      
my opinion
      "omg! this book! i had a lot of feelings! anger. sadness. happiness and many more and the chapter i most loved was the duelling club. it was so funny to see professor snape disarmed lockhart until he was flying because of the impact of professor snape's spell hahaha. xd"    "i don't like calling lockhart a professor because he clearly didn't know any spells that were usefull for his students or anyone... maybe just a memory charm. but it was only usefull for him to do his nasty business. ugh and he was a liar too. all those books he wrote were all faked. "        'if hogwarts were real  i would be really happy to learn all about defence against the dark arts. this is the most interesting subject that have really caught my interest since i began reading the first book. what about you guys? tell me on the comment section below! ^^'    'and that duelling club was so amazing! learning how to fight with spells! '              'and what schocked me was that voldemort was used to be a human! and voldemort was not his real name. his real name was tom marvolo riddle but he changed it. '    "i mean  not an ordinary human of course. he was a half-blood. his father was a muggle and his mother was a witch. i knew he was a slytherin and he studied at hogwarts too but i never thought him as half-blood was or a child or a teenager. because he was so evil that i couldn't even imagine what he would look like in the past and he *coughs coughs * used to be handsome..."          'oh! i love quidditch too! i don\'t really like sports but it\'s different with quidditch. quidditch is wonderful and amazing! i even always scream like " you can do it harry! you can catch it!" and when gryffindor wins i always scream like " yay!! gryffindor! gryffindor!

❝it is our choices  harry  that show what we truly are  far more than our abilities.❞
      harry potter and the chamber of secrets  ' starts off where '  harry potter and the sorcerer's stone  " left off. harry goes back to his old home for summer and spends time with his ugly family  the dursleys. they are no different then they were before but in fact are even more rude. as harry thinks about going back to hogwarts  a new and ugly creature appears in harry's bedroom as harry returns upstairs. his name is dobby and he is known as a house-elf  one that is treated badly. but dobby didn't come to chat with harry  he came to warn him. warn him about hogwarts and "  save him  "  telling him he must not return to hogwarts. he says this because he is trying to warn harry and tell him that he can put the whole school in danger including his friends and himself. but because harry does not listen and is actually able to go back to hogwarts thanks to his best friend ron  a lot of things happen this second year and some aren't the best. some include agony being made and being taken back in time  a new professor named gilderon lockheart  a spirit/ghost who died in hogwarts and now haunts the girls bathroom named moaning myrtle  and even events having to do with ron weasley's younger sister  ginny. these aren't the only events happening and the only ones making hogwarts suffer. they actually have nothing to do with it. there is something—or maybe someone—who is leading hogwarts to danger and putting everyone at risk. this person  or thing  is turning students into stone  writing on the walls  and killing a professor's cat. as rumors spread  nobody knows who this might be. it might be draco malfoy  since he is known as an evil child wizard in slytherin  or maybe hagrid  since he has been in hogwarts for a very long time  including his studying years there. or any other professor  including snape  dumbledore  mcgonagall  or even lockhart. but if it isn't any of those  then it might just be harry himself."      "i really don't know what to say. words aren't possible because this book was just so wonderful and so fun. there were even more magical journeys and i was so glad everyone has changes and j.k. rowling decided to changer everyone's character. well  almost. where do i start? harry is still the cute cinnamon roll and i love his precious and cute character. i hate how he had to suffer even more with the dursley's and had to even go back as the second year ended. i hope he escapes one day for good and never returns because i am so tired of him being treated like shit and like he really does not exist. his family is the only family he really has  yet they treat him like they wish he was dead and didn't survive the chamber of secrets. sure  that's what they wish  but they should show a little more empathy with him and treat him a little better  maybe feed him more food and give him better clothes  let him go out with his owl and have some freedom  let him write back to his friends when they know he is miserable with them  and just be the young harry potter he was made to be. other than that  he is growing and growing into a much better wizard and is slowly learning even more spells  which he ended up using some to defend his friend and fight draco with."      "ron  oh ron he is so cute and precious but so dumb in such cute ways. he still can't figure out the right magic spells and how to use them  making the rest of the crowd laugh at him because of his silly actions. he's so funny and when he's worried  his face reactions are so cute but so heartbreaking at times because he is just so adorable. draco didn't mock him like he did in the previous book and i was glad for that but he still received laughter from others because of the message he got from his mother  the way he tried learning transfiguration  and for needing his mother to defend him. he isn't learning quick like harry but i know the time will come and he will become a good wizard and be able to change things into the right objects  be able to drive a flying car correctly  and defend his friend like he defended him when he needed the saving. "      "hermione was probably my favorite. she has changed so much and isn't a bossy high-top nerd anymore. she's always at the top  able to answer questions before anyone and earning gryffindor points  and that is the reason i loved her a lot more. what would gryffindor  harry  and ron do without hermione? like my friends have said  probably dead or lost because they can't figure out what to do or how things work. she actually breaks rules in this book to help harry and ron and is also helping them with the secrets they are trying to discover. she still supports harry with his quidditch matches and is there for them when they need help  even when she wasn't supposed to."      "you might be wondering what the 4 stars mean? well  like others  ginny was my least favorite character. i wish she didn't get in the way and wasn't the reason for the secrets  but she was also really dumb. she acted dumb in front of harry and tried stepping up for him  only embarrassing herself. she was embarrassed by her mom because she was accepted into gryffindor  but she was still dumb. she didn't have to listen to riddle and could've made the choice of leaving everything out. of course  the book would be different and maybe quite boring if it wasn't for her  but i still didn't like her character majority of the time. i hear she's one of the least favorite characters and i can see why. she's pretty annoying and is always blushing when she sees harry. i'm guessing she likes him? dobby was not my favorite either  only because he tried telling harry what to do but at the end  sure  i liked him and was glad he was free because malfoy was not a good master for him. he kicked and hit him for no reasons  so i'm sure that the reason for his actions when harry told him to sit."      "the friendship has definetely grown and hermione  ron and harry are just best friends. they worry about each and everything about them together is just so cute. i will admit that i liked this one a little less than the first one  but just a little bit. i don't use half stars or anything anymore  so don't be thinking the first one was better and this one had its flaws because it really didn't disappoint me. i just hated some characters and that happens in all novels  and draco is still one of them. he's an asshole  fight me! like him or not  i feel like i will always hate him. i feel like he will grow out to be just like this father and become an evil wizard like all slytherins do. i know his appearance won't change and his personality won't either. he treats harry like shit as well because of who he is and sometimes he thinks he's cool because of his father. but his father is nothing but a lousy and loud man that tries to show off because of his son and because of what he can afford. there was nothing new about him and i hate him for almost everything. well  everything actually."      "harry potter and the chamber of secrets did not disappoint and left me upset  but it had different flaws than the first one. bad ones  but i'm sure they'll be fixed sometimes. i just didn't like dobby at the beginning  but like i said  i was glad he was free at the end and defended harry from lucius malfoy. i know every story has its own improvement and all analyze  but this one might be my least favorite. it's like i see it coming. overall  i can't wait to see where the next journey takes off and how harry will escape the dursley's again.          "]['                        this is the worst book in the harry potter series. the fact that i’m still giving it four stars sort of says something about my opinion for the rest of the series. it’s a wonderful world. the magic is alive and the storytelling is extraordinary  but here are three reasons why this could never be five stars in my estimation like the rest:'      '1.\tgilderoy lockhart. the man is ridiculous to the point of revolting. i don’t need to say anything else.

'            'the first one is a genuine reason and the last two mere petty grievances. there was also something a little off about this book. the writing wasn’t quite at the same level. from here though  it only got better!          '][' '  since pretty much everyone i know has read these books  i figure reviewing them is pretty pointless. but with the new book coming out in a couple of weeks  i have to go through them beginning to end. to make the reviews more entertaining  i will be doing them in a variety of unexpected formats. for this review  i will be writing as someone who's just getting into freudian theory.      'from the very beginning  the true nature of this story is quite obvious - the chamber of secrets. there is only one "chamber of secrets" that is of any human concern  and it is no coincidence that the book of such a title was written by a woman.'      'by sending her young  immature male character  harry (whose name  along with tom and dick  just happens to be one of the "universal" male names) into the mysterious chamber  rowling is exploring her memories of early childhood sexuality. the chamber is filled not only with mystery  but danger and legend - its very existence is debated  which no doubt refers to the elusive female orgasm.'      "ms. rowling  whose sexual impulses have no doubt been unfulfilled over the years  is attempting to fulfill them by way of her own fiction. she has created a perfect sexual explorer in harry potter - a young  innocent and noble young man whose powers have not yet matured. obviously a male that rowling would feel comfortable with. this is especially interesting given the actual resident of the chamber of secrets - a huge  deadly serpent. and there's only one thing that a huge  terrible serpent can represent."      'rowling\'s sexual past is the fertile ground in which this book was grown. it is her cathartic attempt to win over the guilty feelings that she\'s repressed from her former sexual life  the one she regrets more than anything else  by manufacturing a hero. that hero  in harry potter  represents the type of man for whom she would "open" her "chamber - pure of heart and noble of intention and  most importantly  under her control. the vanquishing of the serpent-symbol is her victory  leaving her free to explore other aspects of her life  including the eventual resolution of the electra complex that appears to have been built up around professor dumbledore...

"one of my favourite aspects of the chamber of secrets is finding out more about voldemort's background. the scenes in the chamber itself are great as more tidbits are unravelled and he reveals exactly what has been going on. another highlight of chamber of secrets is the introduction of dobby!! he has a big heart and means well... even if he almost kills harry in the process. oops. once again  hermione is the mvp and proves yet again that those two would have not got very far without her. hermione is basically the samwise gamgee of harry potter. i also like how malfoy seems to have a bigger role in this story  he's fun to hate at this point. this book also introduces us to gilderoy lockhart - his narcissism literally cracks me up and i love that hermione harbours a little crush for him. colin also slays me when he is obsessed with harry!"      "i just love how much i actually snigger to myself when reading these books. it's such a testament to rowling's writing that she has created this story that will fascinate children of all ages  and yet you can equally enjoy it as an adult. harry potter transcends all ages! and that is truly magical. 4 glittering sparkly stars!          "]['                        i did a re-read of this. i listened to the previous book last year and i got around to book two. '      'i remember reading this the first time and it was amazing. it took the wizarding world and what we knew nad expanded everything using mostly the same formula. i thought it was so much better than the first book at the time. '        'spoilers ahead:'            "i appreciate that harry is a young 12 year old kid and so he has help all through this book  his friends and even dumbledore. some people think the end is too pat  but i think it is modeled after mythology. i feel it's very obvious that jo knows her mythology deeply. she understands the role of things in a story and everything for a great myth is here. harry has to stand against tom on his own  but he still has help from dumbledore in the form of fawkes. "      "i have read these books many times now and it's as thrilling to read them now as it was back in 2000. jo has all the ducks in a row and she doesn't miss many tricks here. we can see hints for the rest of the series that i know will pay off later. it's a fantastic book that deserves a place in history. "      "it's also interesting reading about gilderoy - a narcissist  while we have one as president at the moment. it's interesting to see the similarities. they are all puffed up saying they can do everything when in reality  they don't seem to be good at much  really."      "i would find it interesting to know how much has been written by people about these books. i bet its billions of words at least. my niece and nephew have recently read these books and they watch the movies on repeat. they simply love the world of harry potter. what i love about jo's writing style is it appeals to children while an easy read for adults. during the publication of this series  there were many adults reading these books and enjoying them at the time. many people  aunts  uncles  cousins  moms  in my family would read them and then we would discuss them. it's a series the whole family can enjoy."      'it got a whole generation reading and i love that about these books. it was written when the movies for lord of the rings were delighting audiences and the two things together brought the fantasy genre mainstream in a new way. most people in the world have heard of harry potter.'      "i love these books so much and i'm loving being able to do another re-read and enjoy what jo has crafted.          "][' '   i'll be in my bedroom  making no noise and pretending i'm not there.       'ironically  that is what i did as i read this book cover-to-cover.'      'as much as i love the start of it all  the second book really holds. not only as a sequel but also through time. from third grade until now  i\'ve always looked forward to the second book (especially considering it\'s still part of the "happy arc" as i like to call it (books 1-4)).'      audiobook comments    'read by jim dale - and he absolutely nailed it. love the way this man reads.'      youtube  ' | '  blog  ' | '  instagram  ' | '  twitter  ' | snapchat @miranda.reads '      'happy reading!          ']["                        i can't believe i never read these book before. again i really enjoyed harry potter. my favourite quote from this book is 'it is our choices  harry  that show what we truly are  far more than our abilities'          "][' '  ❥ 5 / 5 stars      'great job  harry! five stars for the chamber of secrets.          ']['                        3.5*'      'definitely liked it better than first book. loved the bickering among the trio  and their friendship has gotten deeper  so are their characters.           ']["                        i have lost count on how many times i have re-visited this series and every time i come back i feel like i'm going home because these characters and this world will always have a special place in my heart and i owe it all to j.k rowling. "        "i remember when i was little and i had to sneak into my older brothers room because he had the books and i didn't at the time  i would take them and read them and my childhood was magical like many other people's childhood all thanks to this series. "       it is our choices  harry  that show what we truly are  far more than our abilities.        plot:   " this book picks up with harry once again spending the summer with his family at number 4 privet drive. waiting for the summer to end so he can finally return to hogwarts and be with his new found friends ron and hermione. however the journey to getting there isn't the best because dobby the house elf thinking he's doing harry a favour stops him from walking through the barrier making him and ron miss the train so they result to flying a car to school. the school year starts of bad for harry and ron with them almost getting expelled from the school  but things at the school start to go from odd to strange where the teachers and students life's are put in danger when the chamber of secrets is re-opened after 50 years. "      "even though chamber of secrets isn't one of my favourites in the series i was listening to this for the first time via audiobook and say since growing older and reading it a few more times i can understand appreciate the story more since i've matured. "         characters:   ' '         harry potter:   " harry is put to his second ultimate test in the second book after a shocking start to the school year harry finds himself dealing with all the crazy laws and accusations that have come with the chamber of secrets being opened. after its revealed that he can talk to snakes the whole school and some teachers become skeptical about him and this begins his year of trying to prove everyone in the school wrong. i'm glad harry has ron and hermione who believed him from the beginning because if they didn't i feel like harry would be on his own entirely. as the school year progresses and some of the muggle born students. mrs norris and nearly headless nick are petrified it all comes down to harry to stop it from happening to any more people  were harry meets voldemort for the second time and naturally defeats him. "         ron weasley:   " ron is one of harry's best friends throughout the entire series and he provides the comedic relief and trys to see things as rational as he can. i feel like ron is very underestimated out of the three and its because he is shunned between a famous boy and a clever witch  but i think ron has an edge on both of the two since he is from a family who grew up in this wizard world so i think it gives him more information that the other two don't know. ron is also dealing with being put on a scale so high because of who his brothers are and how well they've all done in school so i feel ron knows it and has that to deal with. "         hermione granger:   " one of my favourite characters in this series  because she is truly the brightest witch of her age and i love how she doesn't care what anybody things about her in the way she is so smart and how she looks even though she does get teased by malfoy and the rest of slytherin because of this. hermione is the one who fights for whats right and brings a lot of political issues to the surface that this wizarding world seems to be having and yes this world has it's troubles that effect not only hermione but every muggle born student  house elf etc. she does grow from the first book but don't get me wrong she doesn't change from being that geeky girl who loves to learn which i love about this character. "        when in doubt  go to the library.          hearing voices no one else can hear isn't a good sign  even in the wizarding world.         "this is one series that i will always continue to come back to because it's what got me into reading and got me started for my love of books and i will always be thankful for jo for writing this magical series. i honestly can't thank her enough because this series is and always will be important to me.
