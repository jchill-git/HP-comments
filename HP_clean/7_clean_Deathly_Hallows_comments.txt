[' '  “i’m going to keep going until i succeed — or die. don’t think i don’t know how this might end. i’ve known it for years.”  ' — harry potter'      'most seventeen-year olds don’t view the possibility of an early death as being  well  possible. but then again  most seventeen-year olds haven’t come face-to-face with death almost half a dozen times before their first kiss either.'      'in '  harry potter and the deathly hallows  '  the seventh and final installment of the ridiculously popular harry potter series  j.k. rowling brilliantly ties up every loose end that she has planted over the last ten years since the very first outing of the series was published in 1997. truly  rowling has learned exactly what her fans want and subsequently delivers a book that answers every potterhead’s questions — and then some. '      'not only does '  deathly hallows  ' revisit key places and characters from all of the previous six books  but rowling even manages to make clever references to previous bits of dialogue from her earlier books. case in point: near the end of the first potter book  after hermione fails to see the magical solution to saving the trio from a nasty patch of devil’s snare  harry’s best mate ron bellows “have you gone mad? are you a witch or not?” now  six years later  hermione finally gets her revenge on her red-headed friend when ron believes that all is lost until hermione yells to him '  “are you a wizard  or what?”  ' thus reminding ron to use his wand to solve their problem. subtle references such as this are a large part of what makes rowling’s books so enjoyable to re-read as there are always deeper meanings and additional allusions that are often only discovered via multiple read-throughs.'      'harry’s bold statement regarding his own potential death is also a prime example of how much rowling truly wrote harry’s last tale for her long-time fans. this line seems to read as a secret “shout-out” to the potterites who have also known for years that the series might not end happily ever after. the prophecy in the fifth book revealed that “neither shall live while the other survives”  and therefore by the end of book seven either harry or voldemort had to die. rowling cleverly fills her last installment with so many twists  turns and complications  however  that it becomes practically impossible to determine which way this book is going to end. '      'more than any of the other potter books  '  deathly hallows  ' is a true quest narrative  with the trio spending the majority of the story hunting for horcruxes and hallows whilst evading capture by voldemort’s death eaters. the multiple close-calls that all three main characters find themselves in throughout the book add to the tension that continues to build until the predictably bloody battle at the end of the tale. the book does  after all  chronicle a brutal war  so be prepared for a lot of killing and  consequently  a lot of tears. '      'this is not to say that '  deathly hallows  ' doesn’t offer up a great deal of laughs as well. the hilarious twins fred and george weasley make several appearances to ensure that the book isn’t all doom and gloom. by far  the funniest part of the story is the secret radio show '  potterwatch  '  anonymously hosted by former hogwarts quidditch commentator lee jordan with special appearances from fred  george  and ex-defence against the dark arts professor remus lupin. rowling perfectly mixes this blend of humour  tragedy and adventure so that her epic-length novel never lags or drags.'      'to write a 607 page book that millions of die-hard fans around the world are able to devour in less than 24 hours is no mean feat  but rowling’s farewell to the boy who lived is an incredibly gripping page-turner that will leave all potter lovers immensely satisfied.

"reading books one to five i was very impressed with the storytelling from a novice novellist. there was magic  there were characters you could love  and sure there were some cliche'd storylines  but they were interspersed with really interesting sidestories (peeves  spew  weasley's wizard wheezes). i was enthralled as a teenager and i am enthralled now as an adult when i re-read them."      'but i have to say the the quality dropped markedly in books six and seven. the ramblings (that started out cute in gof and ootp) have become pronounced and boring. the characters have lost much of what made them endearing  and the plot has gone to hell.'      "focusing on deathly hallows  i had a very strong feeling that six months before her deadline  jkr went on to the internet  discovered that everyone had guessed her 'twists' (honestly  who didn't know that harry was an accidental horcrux  rab was sirius's brother  the diadem was at hogwarts  the locket was at grimmauld place  dumbledore ordered snape to kill him  snape was in love with lily and ron would be a it and abandon harry and hermione?)  and felt the need to come up with a new plot device. this would explain the incredible stupidity that is the deathly hallows and the plot holes and gaps in logic that involve them."      "now  it has been a while since i read it so some of my names and such might be wrong  and if it does answer the questions in the book in such a round about way i apologise  but the elder wand does not make sense. i'm willing to accept that it follows it's own set of rules separate from those of other wands (where haary can use hermione's wand almost as well as his own and all of the disarming they did in book five didn't make their wands all change ownerships) but the course of events whereby harry became the owner of the wand are just plain silly. if grindelwald simply stole the wand from gregorovich (sp?)  how did that make him the wands owner? if the wand is unbeatable  how did dumbledore defeat grindelwald (i know rita skeeter theorised that grindelwald surrended  but how does that pass the wand's ownership to dumbledore. surrender is not the same as defeat). and if the wand is unbeatable  why was dumbledore unable to defeat voldemort when they dueled on ootp? and also  is harry really so conceited and stupid to think that no one would ever defeat or disarm him  making them the owner of the wand? shouldn't he have broken it? if he does become an auror in later life someone is bound to disarm him eventually  and if they knew about the wand  they could easily steal it back from dumbledore's tomb."      "the other major thing that ticked me off was the characterisation. hermione  harry and ron have always been some of my favourite characters  but here they are acting completely different from previous books. harry using unforgivable curses without a hint of remorse  and not comforting hermione when ron takes off  instead staring at a 'ginny-dot'. can we say creepy and stalkerish? "      "and hermione  who for the most part was still loyal and brave and smart (loved the bottomless bag bit  and her being there for harry at godric's hollow)  was so pathetic when it came to ron. i know love makes people do the wacky  but crying for days on end when they're supposed to be searching for horcruxes  kissing him in the middle of the war because he finally showed a tiny inkling of care towards the house-elves. "      "and ron. gah! i mean  i love ron  but you would have thought he could have grown up a little  just a smidgen. but no  running away because of the locket (one ring to rule them all...). those who defend him saying it affected him more than harry or hermione because he had more insecurities is just dumb. harry and hermione had just as much to be insecure about. harry  with his saving-people-thing  could easily have gone nuts with the locket around his neck and ran away from the others because he was terrified that they'd get killed. and hermione has always been insecure  about being muggle-born  about proving herself  about ron and harry and their friendships. sure  he wanted to come back the moment he left  but he still left. which i could accept were it not for such a stupid reason. and then he got his 'super-moment' which was so lame. honestly  'ron can remember and copy paseltongue'  uhuh. wouldn't it have made much more sense to say  have ginny come along  who could possibly still say the word from when she opened it under tom's control in cos. and then ron mentioned the house-elves  to make himself 'worthy' (jkr's words  not mine) of hermione. for one thing  why does he need to make himself 'worthy' since she already loved him for all his insensitivity and insecurity  and why did that 'worthiness' have to be something that harry already had in abounds?"      "yes  i am a h/hr shipper  but that is by no means the reason i hated this book (as you can see from above). if h/hr had been handled as badly as r/hr or h/g  i would have hated it. but the fact remains that the most romantic scenes in this book were between harry and hermione. at grimmauld place when harry showed hermione the picture  at the wedding where hermione beamed at harry  at godric's hollow where they strolled arm in arm under the kissing gate in the snow. while in canon  harry married ginny and ron married hermione  that will never convince me that they are the better couples. harry and hermione had the friendship  the trust  the alchemy. they were the most developed relationship in the series  and the fact that they didn't end up together in the book doesn't change that."      "the final things i feel like picking on - the epilogue came across as being written by a teenage fangirl. no depth  no meaning  just stupid-named kids. i get that jkr wanted harry to end the book with the normal family life he never had  it could have been handled so much better. and seriously  albus severus? that poor kid must have been teased horribly. and why severus? sure  he turned out to be not evil  but for harry to chance his mind about the man after seven years of abuse and ill treatment just because he was scamming on lily. it's just gross. and unrealistic. i was so hoping there was more to snape's story than twenty years of unrequited love. gah. it may have been a sweet way for him to become not evil  but lily was very  very dead for a very long time  and no one holds on that hard to love. if caring for her wasn't enough for him to stray away from the dark arts while she was alive  why was it enough when she was dead?"      "also  the invisibility cloak was supposed to be infallible  and yet moody saw through it in ootp and dementor's could see through it in poa  supposedly. and  my god did the death scene's suck in this book. yes  its a war so plenty of people  including main characters were going to die  but when i felt worse about dobby than i did about remus (who is one of my favourite characters) you just know that the author hasn't put enough emotion into it. he was the last of the marauders  for god's sake  he deserved an on-page death at the very least. maybe defending harry or tonks. something!"      "well  there ends the rant. there were a few good points in the novel (like godric's hollow  before the stupidity of harry not realising that bathilda was nagini  and the awesomeness of neville) but they were few and far between and do not at all make up for the rest of the drivel."

'i’ve heard it said before that everything you need to know you’ve learned in kindergarten. well  that might be somewhat of an oversimplification  but i do think children or young adults who grow into this series  seeing harry and his friends mature as they themselves mature  can glean some pretty important life lessons from it. they are impressionable human beings who are learning about themselves and are starting to make the choices that reflect the kinds of people they want to be.'

'ok  i confess. there was one other scene that i liked... oh god this is the hardest thing i’ve ever had to admit in my life. i want to preface this by saying that i had literally '  just  ' had a panic attack (yes  this book was so boring that i actually started using it to help me calm down in moments of intense anxiety) when i read this scene  so i was very delicate. and i still hate him. with a passion. i never won’t. and you all know what i’m talking about now  so i guess i’ll just come right out and say it: the snape memories had me crying in the corner of my school library during my free period. and i will say this again: i hate snape. i hate him so fucking much. and he is not redeemed by this. not one fucking bit. but now i understand. i understand why some people love him. i understand why he is the way he is. i understand why he killed dumbledore. i understand '  him  "  if not completely  than at least a little more than i did. do i think it’s incredibly unrealistic to love the same person your entire life  even after they’ve been dead for 15 years  when you’ve gotten nothing back from them but a few short years of friendship? yes. but my mum has been telling me i need to suspend my disbelief a little more anyway  so i don't mind so much. honestly  it wasn’t even the love snape had for lily that broke my heart. it was dumbledore’s betrayal. it was when snape found out that dumbledore had him protecting lily’s kid just to let him die. but  none of this excuses his actions throughout the series  or even a lot of his actions throughout the memories. i teared up  i shed a "  single  ' tear (the only tear i shed throughout this entire series btw). i thought the scene was very impactful. but i still hate snape.'      'great  i can '  finally  ' tell you all why i hate this book. so  first of all  '  it is way too long  '. like  my god. this did not need to be 600 pages. nothing  and i mean nothing  happened for the first 23 chapters. seriously. the story consisted purely of travelling around the british countryside and the trio arguing (not just arguing  but having the. same. damn. argument over and over and over again) and whining 24/7. that’s it. and there’s only 36 chapters in the book  which means well over half of the book was boring af. in fact  i was so bored that it took me '  3 months  ' to read the first 29 chapters (chapters 24-29 were boring as well  even if stuff was actually starting to happen (they were the captured-by-the-death-eaters and breaking-into-gringotts chapters btw). that is '  double  ' the amount of time it took me to read the first 6 books. that is fucking ridiculous. like  i have complained about these books being slow and (excluding the first three) way too fucking long  but this book brings a whole new meaning to the word ‘slow-paced’. the worst part is  this book’s movie adaptation was separated into 2 parts. how?? i’m just picturing a bunch of people in a movie theatre snoring  because there is no damn way that movie is at all interesting. but  hey  if i’m ever having trouble sleeping  i know what to watch ;)'      'also  i think i’ve mentioned this in previous reviews  but '  the way rowling plots out her novels makes the entire series feel so disjointed  '. nothing happens for '  at least  ' half the book  and then a whole bunch of shit goes down. and then you move onto the next book  expecting things to be exciting  because that’s how they were when you left off  and it’s back to being boring as fuck. it’s like the whole series is slow  then fast  then slow  then fast and my brain can’t handle it. the pacing needs to be evened out.'      'oh  and then there’s the '  excessive punctuation  '. jesus christ  no one needs that many exclamation points. she chucks one on the end of sentences that don’t even feel like they’re being exclaimed. or she’ll use them when she’s already conveyed that the character is exclaiming something  therefore making the exclamation point redundant. and the ellipses and em dashes and colons and semicolons are just ughhhhhhhh. these books have quite a few basic grammatical errors  so i really don’t understand why rowling is trying to use all of this ‘fancy’ punctuation. if you can’t even get the basics right  just leave the em dashes and the semicolons out of it. they’re not even needed. it just makes the writing feel really childish  which fit the first three books (which just so happened to be the books that weren’t '  as  ' excessively punctuated)  but it doesn’t work with the darker themes of this book.'      'basically  '  i hate jk rowling’s writing  '. the descriptions are another problem. they kind of work when she’s describing the world  because the whole point is that hogwarts and the wizarding world are supposed to feel whimsical. but her descriptions just slow down the pacing of this book  and become horribly tedious after a few hundred pages. and she’s always so focused on the plot and the world that the characters take a back seat. and i know  a lot of you may not agree with me on this. i get that. but personally  i feel that the main reason i couldn’t connect to harry  or any of the characters in this book  is because we barely get any personality from any of them. they all feel so flat  so cardboard  so one-dimensional  so  well  you get the point. and i know; it can be hard to really delve deep into a character’s psyche when the book is written in third person (and i’m not saying it shouldn’t be written in third-person  because it should be)  but it’s still very  very possible. and  in my opinion  '  jk rowling fails to effectively express the personality of any of the characters in a way that portrays them positively  '. all i really can do is hate these characters  because i don’t understand their actions. and i don’t understand any of the characters’ actions  because i don’t understand '  them  '. this is why i actually liked the chapter with snape’s memories  because  even though the whole thing was very info-dumpy (well  more like personality-dumpy)  at least i finally understood '  one  ' character  even if i still hated him. i just wanted more from the characters. they didn’t even feel real; sure  they’re wizards  but they’re also people (or at least  they’re supposed to be people)  but it didn’t feel like they were. i would’ve loved to see some human struggles along with the magical ones; harry shaving for the first time and cutting himself  hermione experimenting with makeup  ron dealing with voice cracks. i don’t know  just something that would make these characters feel like they were teenagers. something that would make them feel real. because  to me  they felt like they were just characters in a book  so i could never really connect to them.'      'like  ok  to give you an idea of how little i connected to the characters  '  i didn’t care at all when any of the characters died  '. not even fred. and he was my favourite fucking character in the series (i’m still salty af about that death btw. like  i don’t mind characters dying (though in this book it’s excessive. like  it’s just a cheap way to evoke emotion  but it’s never any important character that dies. i’m glad it’s at least realistic)  but you can’t kill off fred and not give me george’s reaction. i don’t care how ron feels. i don’t care how percy feels. i want to know how george  fred’s '  twin  '  feels. but i never got to see that).'      'so speaking of characters  '  harry is fucking pointless  '. and i’m not just saying that because i hate his fucking guts (though  i do hate his fucking guts; he’s a whiny  arrogant  impulsive  stupid  self-obsessed twat with a hero-complex). every fucking thing he needed throughout this book was handed to him on a silver platter. he needed the sword of gryffindor? along comes a random doe patronus  and there you have it (you could argue that he had to jump into the freezing cold water to grab it  but he literally failed. ron got the sword. harry still hasn’t done anything). he needed the location of the horcruxes? well here’s voldemort  thinking of all the horcruxes and their specific location right when harry is tuned into volde-radio. he needs a new way to break the horcruxes because all he ever does is fuck everything up (in other words  he lost the sword)? well here’s ron (yes  ron) with some basilisk teeth (which doesn’t even make sense btw. you’re telling me  that the stupidest person in this entire series (excluding harry  ofc) somehow managed to remember a parseltongue word that harry said when he was '  twelve  ' and repeat it exactly? i had to suspend my disbelief just to go along with the idea that ron had actually come up with this plan. but this? this is just too much). seriously  though  the only thing harry does in this book is fuck up. the '  one  ' time he actually did anything  it didn’t even mean anything. he went to save the diadem from the fire  because he had to destroy the little part of voldemort’s soul that was within it. but  when he actually does manage to save the diadem  turns out  there was no need  because the fire was actually magic fire  which is one of the few things that destroys horcruxes. in other words  the whole thing was fucking pointless. '      'and when harry isn’t being handed the solutions to his problems physically  they’re being handed to him mentally. the amount of fucking times harry '  just knows  ' something throughout this book infuriated me. you don’t just know something. you actually have to use your brain to solve problems. but not precious little fucking harry potter  no  he just knows the answers. i’m so done.'      'and holy fuck  the amount of time harry spends mooning over ginny is ridiculous. '  harry and ginny have spoken three fucking sentences to each other throughout the whole series  but i’m supposed to believe they’re in love??  ' fuck off.'      the relationships in general in this book sucked  ':'    '-ron and hermione are terrible to each other. they argue constantly  they belittle each other  hermione literally attacked ron when he came back  ron left in the first place for a stupid af reason. they just don’t work. i don’t ship it. they become terrible people when they’re together  and it’s not healthy. also  the amount of time they spend moping about each other is ridiculous and i just can’t deal with it.'    '-tonks and lupin had never even interacted  and then all of a sudden they’re married with a baby??? like  wtf happened there? did they introduce themselves like:'    'lupin: hey  i’m remus  you’re hot and way too young for me  do you want to get married and have a baby?'    'tonks: hey  i’m nymphadora  but you can call me tonks. you could probs be my father  but sure  sounds good.'    "seriously  their whole relationship was out of nowhere and felt like rowling’s cheap attempt to make it more emotional when they were to inevitably die. like “hmmm  these deaths don’t feel sad enough. maybe if i put these two together and they had a baby that they leave behind when they die  it would be more emotional. yeah  let's do that.”"    '-lily and james are a joke  right? like  there’s a fucking hidden camera somewhere  and jk rowling is about to jump out and yell that i was pranked and they aren’t really together because this makes less sense than lupin and tonks. in every single pensieve memory  lily hates james. but then they get married and have a kid?????? seriously  no. this can’t be real. it doesn’t make sense. i’m fucking done.'      'hah  wow  ok  i’m really getting pissed now. i’m sorry if i’m sounding harsh or horrible or mean or whatever. i don’t mean to. i’m just so mad at this book. however  in saying that  i will now proceed to rant like i’ve never fucking ranted before: harry dies. i have spent the past six books pleading for some tension  for some stakes  to feel like at any moment  harry could be dead. i have wanted that suspense from the start. and i finally  finally  am proven wrong. all those times i said the jk rowling would never kill off her perfect little pure-of-heart harry  i was wrong. because here he was  about to die. and i was willing to give this book 4 stars  just for harry’s death. i was willing to '  like  ' this book. because how brilliant would that have been? but i was blinded by that little inkling of hope i still had that this series wasn’t garbage. because he doesn’t fucking die at all  does he? instead  we get the '  worst  ' cliche in the fucking world: the main-character-dies-but-then-comes-back-to-life-because-i-need-to-evoke-emotion-out-of-my-readers-but-can’t-bare-'  actually  '-killing-off-my-mc trope. i hate it. '  harry is fucking invincible and i can’t fucking stand it  '. he was dead. i was rejoicing. you can’t take that shit away from me. ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i’m so fucking done i can’t take this anymore.'      'i interrupt your regularly-scheduled rant review for a fun segment called “hp is riddled with plot holes why do people like this?” (the title is a work-in-progress).'      'first of all  why isn’t harry dead? did dumbledore not say that the only thing keeping harry alive was the fact that voldemort was also alive  and therefore the piece of harry in voldemort was alive? harry should be fucking dead rn (and i’m not just saying that because i’m salty).'      'also  the elder wand. my god is that thing a plot hole. like  ok  you have to defeat the current owner to be it’s new master  right? but didn’t grindelwhat’shisface steal it from the wandmaker dude? is that defeat? i think not. it’s also supposed to be unbeatable  but dumbledore literally beat him when they duelled. and in ootp (unless i’m remembering wrong  which is likely)  did dumbledore and voldemort not duel? i don’t recall dumbledore winning  but he literally had a wand that’s entire  like  thing (i’ve run out of words  ok?) was that it was supposed to always win. and then harry was the true owner of the wand?? by disarming draco?? how tf was draco the owner? am i missing something? and if all you have to do to get the wand is disarm the owner  then are you telling me that no one  '  no one  '  disarmed harry at all during the time that he was supposedly the true master of the wand????? no  that can’t be  he’s fucking 17 guys. he dropped out of high school ffs. i’m not saying he’s bad at magic  but even voldemort was disarmed at some point. even dumbledore was disarmed at some point. harry isn’t immune...except  oh wait  he is  for some fucking reason  hence why there is no bloody tension throughout the entire series; because nothing bad ever happens to harry. but my point is that the elder wand doesn’t make sense; it’s an unbeatable wand that you can only own if you beat its previous owner. that’s literally a fucking paradox. i’m so done.'      'i’m not even going to mention the epilogue. '  if i didn't know better  i'd think some random harry potter fangirl won a contest to write the epilogue  because that’s how much it read like fan fiction  ". and the names of their children! like  a) does ginny just not get a say? and b) albus severus?????? that poor fucking kid. i’d hate my father too if i was named that. but seriously  harry spent half of this book hating on dumbledore  and the entirety of the series hating on snape. wtf is he naming his kids after them for? albus i might understand as a middle name  maybe  because he was harry’s mentor. but fuck off with severus. you don’t hate someone for your entire life  find out they were super creepy but also loved your mum  and then name your fucking kid after them. the whole thing felt like a gimmick. also  i’m just pissed that harry and ginny ended up together. and holy fuck  ron. will he ever grow up? he literally tells the kids that if they aren’t in gryffindor  they will be disowned. like  whilst albus is fucking freaking out that his family is gonna hate him if he’s in slytherin. like dude  not the time to say something like that  even if it was a joke (and it didn't sound like one). and all the shit he told rose about malfoy’s kid. seriously  mate  you don't know that kid. don't go around telling people to hate him. he's 11 (and probably more mature than ron  ffs)."      "overall  this book is trash. and i can’t be fucked properly concluding this. i probably missed  like  a ton (just realised i forgot to mention the whole dumbledore thing  when harry is “dead”. my entire point was that the scene was shit  as it was literally just dumbledore being like “harry  you’re so perfect  like  i’m shit  but you’re perfect” and it was the stupidest thing ever. the worst part is  this all happened in harry's head. how arrogant does harry have to be to "  literally imagine dumbledore saying he's perfect over and over again  '. ughhhhhhhhh)  but i’m seriously so done with this series. goodbye harry potter  i hope i never have to deal with your bs ever again.

book review

    ' 4+ out of 5 stars to '  harry potter and the deathly hallows  '  the seventh and supposedly final book in 2007 by '  j.k. rowling  '. but then "cursed child" came out last year... so is a series really over? not in our hearts and minds  my friends... neither shall this one be... and although i considered spending a huge part of today drafting a very thorough review of harry potter  my instincts kicked in and told me not to do so... instead  let\'s meet up and talk about it somewhere if you want to get into the details. i literally don\'t have the ability to write everything i am thinking about when it comes to these books... and i wrote my first novel in less than 3 months with not a stitch of writer\'s block.'      "sometimes things just flow out of your creativity and into the world's waiting and willing hands. and that's exactly what's happened with the hp book series. it's the kind of book where you can read it at any age and feel a deep connection. you can re-read it and watch the movie all in the same day and never be bored or feel the need to do anything else. when hp movies are running on tv back-to-back over a weekend  i always catch a few of them."      'these characters are wonderful. the plot is just brilliant. and in this last book  when all the surprises burst from within our own little goblet of fire  we find true nirvana in a set of books unlike any other. from drama to shock  sadness to beauty  deathly hallows re-invents the construct of an emotional roller-coaster. whether you read the whole series or just picked up the last one  you feel the power inside the text... especially when you consider it all started with an innocent and scared little boy who lived under the stairs at 4 privet drive.'      "we are all harry potter at one point in our lives or during the course of his life. could be when you were a child searching for someone to love you  or it may be now as an adult looking back on the differences you faced in the eyes of good versus evil. whatever the connection is  you'll feel it until you are no more... and while this may seem like an exaggeration or a rather ethereal point of view... one thing i know is true:"      we all make the exact same face when we hear or think of anything to do with his amazing story: there's a brief pause  our lips curl  our eyes roll back a little as we shut out lids  our breath thins out towards the back of our throat  and our hearts all decide it's ok to stop beating for just that 1 second. and in our collective sigh of "i love harry potter" exclamations  we are all for once  connected by a shared intense feeling that might be strong enough to fuel the world's future.

'but now that i\'ve spent the last couple of weeks reading it aloud to my son  i understand why i loved it so much. does anyone fully appreciate the scope of what rowling did with this book? she spent years upon years  and six other books building a world and populating it with characters  and then she brought it and them all together. spells  tools  people  events  that had been sprinkled throughout the other six books were now smoothly woven together into this last great battle. and yes  they spend a lot of time camping  but as harry says to ron  "did you think we\'d be finding a horcrux a day?" no  i didn\'t  or at least i hoped that they wouldn\'t  because that would have been too pat  too unrealistic. instead  they had to search  they had to learn  they had to struggle  and be bored  and be lost  and then find what they needed. the ron-harry-hermione friendship is tested  and found to be unbreakable. ron and hermione\'s relationship moves forward  harry has time to reflect on his life  the people who have helped him  what his future might hold.'

']["            ** spoiler alert **            was this book so awesome because it finally addressed all those long unanswered questions?\xa0 yes.\xa0 was this book just fantastic because we finally know what happens to everyone?\xa0 yes.\xa0 was this book wonderful because rowling was ruthless and took no prisoners?\xa0 yes.\xa0 was this book splendid because we knew all the characters and cared about them like they were real?\xa0 yes.\xa0 was this book so great because it made you laugh  cry  gasp  emote out loud?\xa0 yes.\xa0 that was one of my favorite things about the book.\xa0 regardless of where i was  whether it be sitting on the couch next to my roommate  alone in my room  or standing in my shop  i found myself cheering and gasping and all other sorts of reactions  i was just that into the story.the most emotional part for me  one of them at least  was when dobby died.\xa0 i don't know what it was about that  but i was sobbing and had tears streaming down my face.\xa0 when they describe putting the socks on his feet  that was the part that opened the floodgates.\xa0 i am one of those people that supports the theory that socks are a very imporant symbol in the harry potter series.\xa0 i even did a report in one of my high school english classes on it.\xa0 "  "ron sat on the edge of the grave and stripped off his shoes and socks  which he placed upon the elf's bare feet.  dean produced a woolen hat  which harry placed carefully upon dobby's head  muffling his batlike ears."  '\xa0 rowling  master of subtle detail  still includes that brief mention of socks.\xa0 it was that which really did me in.another thing that impressed me was how well the story flowed.\xa0 probably a combination of being a good writer and knowing  without a doubt  where the story was going and what she wanted to have happen allowed rowling to keep the story smooth and not jerky.\xa0 so easily  especially in the beginning/middle chapters in harry  ron  and hermione\'s search for horcruxes things could have become so choppy.\xa0 and while time did pass quickly in brief sections it still flowed.\xa0 a lot of writers  even good writers  can\'t seem to make something like that work  yet rowling did  proving herself yet again.i was also really impressed by her ballsy moves of killing off several main characters  especially right in the beginning.\xa0 i thought it was going to be in the big final battle (\'cause c\'mon  you knew it was coming) that we lost all our favorites  not within the first few chapters.\xa0 rip hedwig and mad-eye.\xa0 that was one major way you got sucked in because you\'re thinking  "oh my god!\xa0 characters i love are already dying!\xa0 what the-" and then you keep going because you need to know if anyone else is going to kick it.\xa0 for some reason though rowling just loves killing off my favorite characters  dumbledore  moody  fred (and george too in a way)  lupin  tonks.\xa0 i was especially angry over the lupin/tonks death.\xa0 it felt like a sort of snub because  yay they\'re married!\xa0 yay  they\'re having a baby!\xa0 yay  he\'s a little metamorphmagus.\xa0 boo  both parents are suddenly dead.\xa0 rude.\xa0 but i guess it made the whole thing hurt a lot more  and it did.honestly  i felt rowling tied things up beautifully and not in that harried  "oh yeah about that?\xa0 um... this happens!\xa0 yeah  that\'s it!"\xa0 i think many fans feel vindicated (i.e. the snape/lily shippers  those who thought harry was a horcrux  don\'t mess with mrs. weasley) after reading this book.\xa0 of course there are probably some who are broken down and upset that what they thought was going to happen didn\'t.\xa0 in the end we all got one hell of a story and went on one fantastic adventure.\xa0 no matter what happened  no matter who died or who ended up with who this book was more than i could have hoped for  i was not disappointed at all.all i can say now is: jo  thank you.

"      '[scroll down for my first review  from 2007.]'      "the final harry potter book always looks too short to me  like  how could everything possibly be wrapped up in a book that's not as long as "  the order of the phoenix  "  when there's still so much to do?! i felt that the first time  and i felt that again. but once again i admire rowling's skill in crafting a tremendous story and a powerful ending for what is to me one of the best fantasy series out there. "      "there's a lot going on in this novel  but it's nicely balanced with quieter  slower parts and you really get that last chance to really "  know  " harry  ron and hermione. rowling never lets plot overpower her characters or her story  and she won't be rushed: the pacing is steady and consistent throughout  which only adds to the tension-filled scenes where you start biting your nails."      "this is a book that makes me cry  and i'll tell you why - in a bit. i wondered how i could share all the things i love about this particular book  and figured listing them was probably the best option."      ' '    "\t hedwig dying. i had completely forgotten  and it's so  so sad. i like how they did it for the movie  giving her a role and using her as a visual means of identifying harry  since in the book it's more complicated. "      "\t hermione erasing her existence - removing knowledge and memory of herself from her parents' minds and sending them off to australia under new identities so that they aren't a target. there is something incredibly tragic about this  though it doesn't get much attention. i can't imagine the kind of strength and resolve it would take to do that  though the realities of the world would probably help give you the resolve. "        '\t kreacher becoming an ally. and all for an act of genuine kindness (harry gives him "master regulus\'" locket after hearing his story). and what he was made to do for voldemort. nothing  not even kreacher  is black and white  and that\'s an important lesson to learn. he betrayed sirius at the end of '  the order of the phoenix  "  but when you learn more about him  you realise it's not a simple matter at all. "        "\t dobby's death. he was such a brave  selfless elf  and as characters  he and kreacher really brought into sharp relief the whole issue of house elves and their mistreatment. "        "\t the mortality of the weasley's. until this book  they always struck me as one of those solid features who come close to utter tragedy but always manage to avoid it  like with arthur getting attacked by the snake. here  though  george loses an ear and  at the end  fred is killed. fred's death is one of the saddest things for me.  "        "\t likewise  lupin and tonks' deaths at the final battle - i remember reading that the first time and feeling that sense of utter disbelief. i felt it again here  like someone had surely made a mistake  especially when harry sees their bodies next to fred and their described as sleeping. but with a newborn left behind  and the fact that lupin only recently found the first real happiness he's ever known - to have that cut short  it makes me want to cry just typing this. the deaths of these characters had a much bigger impact on me than the death of dumbledore - as big a surprise as that was on first reading - at the end of "  the half-blood prince  '. in a way  dumbledore had to go so that harry could come into his own. but these characters  their deaths are so needless  and they were too young and left too much behind. '        "\t snape's love for lily. i knew there was a good reason why we forgave snape at the end  but i was glad i couldn't remember exactly what it was. snape is another complex character  who shows that it's not a simple matter of right or wrong  good or evil. he's not someone to be judged at face value or first impressions  though obviously that's what everyone has been doing all his life. it's not even pity that i felt for him  but empathy at losing the woman he loved and sacrificing everything in memory of her. he never stopped loving her. timeless love. no wonder dumbledore trusted him implicitly: he understood the power of such emotions and never dismissed them as insignificant. "        "\t the truth about dumbledore's past  and his sister ariana. so sad. i haven't seen the second half of the movie version yet but i hope they include these details. "        '\t harry walking to his impending death  supported by the ghosts of his parents  sirius and lupin. i cried when james and lily and cedric appeared at the end of '  the goblet of fire  "  and they had no less power here  bolstering their son and being there so he wasn't alone as he went to voldemort  knowing he was going to be killed - and not knowing that he would survive it.  "        "\t the dragon kept imprisoned in gringott's bank. i felt so bad for the poor tortured beast  and so happy when they freed it. "        '\t xenophilius lovegood. the position he was in  having his daughter taken away and used as a threat against him  to betray his beliefs (i.e.  in harry as the chosen one). '      "\t petunia dursley  harry's aunt  is a sad figure in her own right. it becomes clear in this book why she was so anti-magic: she was jealous of her sister lily's ability. the scene where lily mentions that petunia wrote to dumbledore  asking to be let into hogwarts  and petunia's feelings of embarrassment and shame and longing  of feeling excluded - you can't help but feel for the little girl who grew into a resentful woman in denial. "      ' '      "there's lots of happy things here too  like fleur and bill weasley's wedding and ron and hermione finally getting together  as well as great mini-adventures that all lead up to the final show-down. the plan to get into the ministry of magic  and later the gringott's bank break-in  for example  were really fun and exciting and scary. and one of my favourite scenes is the neville longbottom snake-killing scene - really  i just love all the neville scenes but that one in particular really stuck in my head all the intervening years since first reading it."      'and underlying it all is this hitler-like race and class war that voldemort is enacting. muggles and mud-bloods become demonised and terrorised and everyone has to prove their "purity". the film captured this really well in the set design  especially inside the ministry.'      "i loved that there was so much i couldn't remember when i started this book - i couldn't remember what the hallows were  or what was inside the snitch  or how they found the other horcruxes. i had forgotten dobby died until i watched the film a few months ago. it was wonderful to read it almost like it was the first time."      'and then there\'s the epilogue - i\'ll mention it because i remember how much fans railed against it when the book first came out. i\'m still not sure why  except maybe it wasn\'t up to the standards of the rest of the series. i read somewhere that rowling wrote it at the beginning  which is kinda cool  and shows just how well she planned it all out. the line that i love is this one  where harry tells his son: "albus severus  [...] you were named for two headmasters of hogwarts. one of them was a slytherin and he was probably the bravest man i ever knew." [p.607] it gets me every time.'        2007 review - 1st reading      'so  there were huge expectations - and quite a few bets  debates and demands - for this last book  and personally i thought it was a great ending to the series. one of the things that i love about these books  that has always impressed me  is how tightly plotted they are  how detailed. others have complained about the plotholes in '  deathly hallows  "  but i didn't see any. granted  i wasn't looking for them  and i didn't succeed in my intention to re-read the previous books before this one (managed "  philosopher's stone  ' but left it too late for the others) so i had forgotten some details. '      deathly hallows  ' made me laugh  made me cry (seriously  i bawled - and there were no tissues at the cottage so had to mop my face with paper towel...)  had me pressing my knuckles to my mouth (the closest i come to biting my nails)  and kept me on the edge of my seat. what more could you ask for? '      "quite a few characters die in this book  but everyone knew there would be some deaths because rowling said there would be. she's also said  apparently  that the books are about death  though  having read the last book  i understand now that she doesn't mean they're about "  death  '  but about '  death  ". the whole idea behind the boy who lived was that his mother's sacrifice protected him from the killing curse  and when harry in turn sacrifices himself  he protects everyone at hogwarts (where all the characters assemble for the big show-down) from lord voldemort. "      "i also liked how the death of dumbledore (in the previous book) and snape's betrayal are resolved; i liked that snape did it all for love of lily  harry's mother. it worked  brought out the humanity that has always lurked deep beneath snape's corrosive veneer. the saddest deaths were of fred  one of the weasley twins  and lupin and tonks  only weeks after the birth of their baby. is it any wonder that i cried? and even though there was always the hope that harry would survive  still the section leading up to his sacrifice was written so convincingly  so non-melodrammatically  that i actually had to put the book down for a minute and do a quick turn about the house to calm myself down a bit. "      "the only bit that looked like a glaring plothole at first was when neville pulls the sword of gryffindor out of the sorting hat to lop voldemort's snake's head off with. that confused me - last we saw of the sword  the goblin had taken it and disappeared into the depths of gringotts with it. then i remembered: harry had pulled the sword out of the sorting hat in the chamber of secrets  too. the last lingering doubt is why the hat was on fire and why exactly voldemort wanted to non-sort them then and there. ah well  it works for dramatic effect! "      "another part of the book which has received a lot of flak: the epilogue. saccharine  it's been described. i have to agree  and it's the only bit of saccharine in the entire series. apparently it was written way back in the 90s  but i don't think that excuses it. it was like icing on the cake - sickly sweet  not at all filling or satisfying  hiding the cake beneath which is what you "  really  " want to eat  as long as you can have the icing too. so we learn how they paired up and what their kids' names are  that neville is a herbology professor and  well  very little else. "      "noticeably  harry's conversation with dumbledore in king's cross station shows how much harry has grown and matured. he's moved through his teenage angst and become reliable  responsible  thoughtful  more patient. by not going after the deathly hallows  his first impulse is tempered by a new  cooler head. aside from the humour  reminiscent of roald dahl  and the plotting  the character development of harry is another reason why the books are so enjoyable  and long-lasting.

']['                        [warning: spoilers ahead but names withheld where possible]'    "the deathly hallows was a fantastic  explosive ending to the incredible harry potter series. all the work rowling did to build this story over nearly 3000 pages to reach this climax is quite an accomplishment. the tension between the quest we learned of in half-blood prince for the horcruxes and that we learn in the beautiful fable of the eponymous deathly hallows is spectacular. the whole book resonates with dark energy - the attack on wizarding society by voldemort's minion's honestly reminds me of the unholy alliance of the ammosexual christofascist right and trump especially in the massive hypocrisy involved - and is extremely well-written throughout. "      "overall thoughts on the series: i really liked how rowling dealt with the janus-type themes of racism and acceptance. the horrors of voldemort's followers tortures and murders of the semi- and non-magical peoples is a frightening reminder of both the shoah and of slavery in america. on the other hand  the composition of team harry with misfits and a relatively decent amount of female protagonists was a fantastic way to discuss diversity. sub-themes about freedom of the press  the loss of innocence  the failing of illusions of youth...all of these are treated with delicate precision. that is perhaps what i appreciate most about rowling's universe - besides the relatively solid consistency from end to end as well as fantastic characters that one wishes they could meet in real life (hagrid!)  there are also subtle and not so subtle calls to a basic pagan morality that doesn't need to call out to the bible (like in a wrinkle in time) or biblical analogies (narnia). "      'that being said  it is fascinating how she built her potterverse with a mixture of greek (centaurs  phoenixes) and hindu (nagini is like the naga of the churning of the sea of milk story) mythologies. she demonstrates a wide-ranging curiosity and creative power of merging various traditions into her own unique fabric which feels familiar and less foreign than  say  the tolkien universe.'

"i think i've made it quite clear throughout my years on goodreads how much the harry potter series and world means to me  but i have yet to do any kind of review on any of the books. this series means so much to so many people  it gave me friends when i had none  and most importantly  the courage to be myself. "      "there are so many wonderful things about this series; how detailed the world is  the history  the myriad of different characters. but maybe my favourite part of the story is how realistic the characters are. they are without a doubt flawed  harry often acting too quick (and without much thought) while trying to carry the world on his shoulders  ron's feelings of intense jealousy that follow him through the whole series  and hermione's sometimes narrow mindedness. these are the things that made me fall in love with these characters. i could see myself in them and they never made me feel less than—they made mistakes just like every other human being. "      'this has marked i think close to the twelfth time i have reread this series  and every time it somehow manages to shape the person i turn into. every time i read this series there is a new problem i am facing  a different quality in myself i am battling with  and i always feel like i take some kind of knowledge or comfort from this series  from all different characters. each time  i relate to a character i had never paid much attention to  i fall in love with an aspect that i never gave much thought to before. '      'i think that no matter where i am in the world or what i am doing  the wizarding world of harry potter will always be my home. '   so until next time  i will miss you.         ' '][' '  and  ' my reread of harry potter is over. it was still as wonderful and heartbreaking as the first time that i tackled this world of magic.'      "if you have never read this series  i suggest that you try to get to it one day. it's a wonderful series to experience magic  amazing creatures  well loved characters and complex plots!"    'the range of emotions that a reader goes through while reading this is pretty intense.'      'bravo  '  j.k. rowling  '  bravo!          ']['                        kaum zu glauben das ich obwohl ich diese geschichte in und auswendig kenne trotzdem beim letzten band immer heulen muss 🙊 :)          '][' '  deathly hallows  ' is in fierce competition with '  half-blood prince  ' as the worst book of the series. it is an extremely bloated book in which nothing much happens for chapters upon chapters because rowling is dragging the storyline out -- so it can end at the end of the school year  like all the other books. many plotlines of previous books are barely touched upon (s.p.e.w.) or "resolved" in an entirely dissatisfactory manner (grawp  though i wasn\'t unhappy about not seeing more of him). '      'characters who were hyped in interviews but turned out to be of little importance include ginny weasley  who winds up doing absolutely nothing of relevance throughout the whole book  whereas she was annoyingly and tediously present (and acting like a complete jerk) in '  half-blood prince  ". despite my dislike of this character  i had expected to see much more of her  and i was disappointed to see her true purpose was bearing harry potter's childrens in one of the  if not "  the  '  least believable "romances" of the series.'      'the book  and the series  then end with a cloying epilogue which tells us little about things that actually matter and instead focuses on who marries who  complete with precocious children (who are naturally of similar ages; so considerate of everyone to get pregnant at the same time!) and insipid names (albus severus  but no child named after ginny\'s dead brother?). i like to pretend this epilogue  or "crapilogue" as disappointed fans have dubbed it  doesn\'t exist  and that the series officially ends after harry kills voldemort. leaves much more to the imagination and is much more of a fitting end.'      "my expectations prior to the release were faily high. that turned out to be a mistake. i won't be rereading this installment any time soon  possibly not ever again.          "]
